they're offering a three percent match on any retirement funds that you transfer over to
robin hood so three percent is truly insane
hey everyone welcome to episode 57 of the daily churn today's episode is going to be a recap of
all of the things that i churned in january and january turned out to be a pretty busy month i
went pretty hard in january and not just from a churning perspective i mean churning wise we've
got a bunch of new credit cards that i opened a lot of interesting brokerage offers
banks cell phones big one on cell phones meal kits so all kinds of good stuff but i was also
doing a bit of traveling in january to kick off the year i think i mentioned it in the the previous
episode but my wife and i went to the miraval in arizona it's one of our favorite hyatt hotels i
think super underrated because people get scared by the fact it costs 65 000 hyatt points per night
if you're traveling with two people if you're traveling with one person i think it's only 45 000
but what a lot of people don't know is that it's only 45 000 people that are traveling with one
is it's all inclusive all meals are covered and on top of that most of the activities there are
free and if you've never heard of the miraval before you're like what are activities what
no so this is basically like camp for adults it is awesome i mean they've got pretty much
everything going on every hour things like slacklining hiking mountain biking yoga meditation
you can even do more new agey stuff that they're known for i think
oprah had stayed there like a decade ago that's sort of their claim to fame but you can take
classes on crystals or tibetan singing bowls like pretty much everything they have a whole schedule
of activities and most of these are covered and you can pay additional but you also get 175 dollars
per night as resort credit so if you're there staying for three nights even if you booked it
on points you're going to get 525 dollars to spend while you're there which you could use
and you can also get a free massage for free so if you're there you can get a free massage for free
and you can also get a free massage for free so if you're there you can get a free massage for free
and so we got two massages for free each during our stay plus a bunch of activities plus all the
free food and so that's why i think it's one of the best deals around for a hyatt and for us we
like to do it at the beginning of the year because it kind of really sets the tone for the whole year
because it's such a relaxing rejuvenating kind of an experience and no this is not being sponsored
by miraval my wife and i have been doing this for a long time and we've been doing this for a long time
actually like can you not do an episode on miraval arizona because we don't want a lot of
people booking it and making it harder to book so this is my compromise i'm just going to mention
it briefly here part of the recap that we spent you know a few days there in january and then
the other thing that ended up taking a lot of time for me in january was booking a bunch of business
class tickets so myself my p2 my wife plus my parents were thinking about making a couple
asia trips in 2024
in 2025 and so i ended up booking 10 business class tickets in january and i still have two
more business class tickets to book i'm waiting for availability for that to open up but things
like japan airlines as an alternative to ana we're going to fly their new business class suites that
they've upgraded to may actually do a dedicated episode on this one in the future but that's sort
of why my january got kind of crazy because i churned a lot of stuff like i really wanted
this year to get off to a good start churning wise and it definitely did but also was on
vacation plus booking just an obscene amount of business class tickets i think i probably burnt
like a million amex points plus another like half million hyatt points so definitely was in the mode
of like okay i've zeroed out my amex balance which is good it's something i've been trying to do for
a while but now it's time to reaccumulate you know i'm starting from zero how do i build that
up quickly and that's going to be
what a lot of this episode today is going to be about so if you've been following the the live
churn tracker that i have on the website i think someone on there left a comment being like hey
you seem to be opening a lot of new credit cards lately and that is a hundred percent sure i am
because i need to rebuild my balance but speaking of the live churn tracker everything that we talk
about today can be found on the tracker you don't need to take notes i have all of the things that
i'm churning along with my own comments and data points and links to all of these churns
and you can find all of it at the daily churn podcast.com slash tracker it's totally free to
join and you also get access to the free newsletter which notifies you anytime one of these new
episodes comes out along with all of the show notes sent straight to your email so definitely
check it out if you haven't but for now let's get back into the january recap because it's a big one
today
starting with credit cards i have been going
pretty hard on credit cards these last couple months um the big one that posted for my p2 was
the capital one venture x business card and that's the one that gave you 150 000 miles for
thirty thousand dollars of spend so open that for my wife my p2 and that posted in january and it
actually ended up being 210 000 points because this card gives you two points per dollar so if
you spend thirty thousand dollars you're going to get sixty thousand points from that spend
on top of the hundred and fifty thousand points as the signup bonus so ended up being two hundred
and ten thousand points total which in the world of capital one can be cashed out for twenty one
hundred dollars towards travel so you can redeem one cent per point towards travel you can also
transfer it to a variety of different travel partners like cafe i think is one of them that
i recently used and so there's a lot of value there for a bonus that size and we like to have
those points around because we usually redeem it for things like travel and we like to have those
things that typically can't be booked on points so whenever we have a rental car booking let's say
with national we'll just redeem capital one points for it because that's how we get our rental car for
free or if we take a taxi in mexico that's definitely not going to be on points boom use
the capital one and redeem the points for that travel expense later because you have up to 90
days to redeem points for a prior travel related expense so really useful card and i actually ended
up opening another one this time for myself so i actually ended up opening another one this time
because i had my p2 refer me for an easy 25 000 points as a referral bonus but the main reason i
wanted to open it was because they increased the offer or rather they improved the offer so
now instead of having to do thirty thousand dollars of spend for 150 000 points you only
needed to do twenty thousand dollars of spend so couldn't really pass up that offer especially
because i'm trying to accumulate more capital one points currently and yeah the approval process at
least for me it was pretty smooth i've seen some data that's been coming out of the app that's
been getting a lot of points especially over on the discord where folks are getting denied for the
card i think with capital one they are a little more strict i mean some things that i think helped
us was that we have had our business for multiple years it makes more than like a thousand dollars
a year i know some people put for their chase applications like my business to sole proprietor
it makes a thousand dollars of revenue a year and chase doesn't really care but i think capital one
they're more like well we want you to have like a real business that's generated
some amount of revenue and i've also had the personal venture x card before and i currently
have a capital one checking and savings account and so i think those factors make it a little
easier for me to get approved versus someone who's totally new to the capital one ecosystem but
if you're able to get approved i think it's a pretty awesome card to have and i think maybe
a question that might have popped up in your head as i'm talking through these capital one cards is
like oh okay thirty thousand dollars of spend twenty thousand
dollars of spend that's a lot of spend to meet in three months and i a hundred percent agree and
if you are having trouble meeting credit card spend definitely would recommend checking out
some of the deals that i posted especially the bank funding deals that quite a few of them are
still alive so worth looking into they're under the deals section of the website there's also of
course buying groups which i did an episode on i think episode 51 and also how to maximize
crograce
refuel points if you want to go the gift card purchasing route. I think that's episode 47.
So a lot of different ways to meet spend. And, you know, it's not that hard to meet 20k or 30k
in a few months if you employ some of those strategies. One other interesting thing that
I actually just discovered with Capital One is that I was trying to get the Capital One
Business Venture X card shipped quicker. Usually with Chase, you can just call them or message
them and ask for expedited shipping. But in the case of Capital One, when I called, they're like,
no, it's a brand new card. So we can't expedite the card. It's just going to go out via snail mail
and it's going to take a couple of weeks. But the agent suggested a pretty interesting alternative.
So I didn't prompt this at all. But what he said was like, well, I can't expedite the original card,
but I could add a non-human user on your card and have that card shipped over to you instead.
And I was like, non-human user? What do you mean? And he's like, yeah, we can just make
a new card.
that's let's say called office expenses and will ship the office expenses card over to you and so
of course you know I'm familiar with authorized users on cards especially with like Amex it's
pretty popular to use like an initial or like a roman numeral if you want to add additional
authorized users that are just sort of yourself but I've never heard anyone especially like an
agent explicitly tell me to just like make up names for my authorized user like office expense
and have it shipped that way and in the case of Capital One that was the recommended approach and
that's exactly what he did I got a FedEx envelope addressed to office expenses that arrived the very
next day with my authorized user office expense card and it's interesting because with Capital
One I think with the Business Venture X as well authorized users and don't quote me on this someone
knows for sure please let me know but I think authorized users get access to Capital One Venture
X lounges plus two guests and in the case of Capital One they don't charge an additional fee
for these authorized user cards and they have a 99 authorized user card limit per account so
the gears in my head are sort of turning of like should I just be sending an authorized user card
to everyone I know so that they get access to this Capital One lounge let me know what you guys think
about that idea in the comments because I'm curious if there's any holes to that but
yeah ended up getting my card super quick so currently working on spend for that hopefully
the bonus will have that posted in a couple months or so but in January I did get P2's Capital One
bonus so 210,000 points from that plus 25,000 points for referring me which by the way if you
need a referral link I have all of my referral links up at the dailychurnpodcast.com slash
referrals really appreciate it if you end up using mine but tallying that it's the 210 plus 25
for 235,000 points from Capital One in January then I also had another pretty big credit card
bonus post in January the Southwest Performance business card that one I'd opened it was 80,000
miles for $5,000 of spend and I did it to try and get the companion pass which would last from 2024
all the way through the end of 2025 so two years worth of free travel for my P2 if you're not
familiar with how companion pass works I did an episode on that and I did a video on that in the
episode episode 10 on it and there's also a great reddit faq that I'll link to in the show notes
that basically answers every possible question you might have about getting companion pass using
credit cards but for me mine posted early in January right in time for our Miraval trip and
it was really close actually it almost didn't happen because I sort of mistimed the spend a
little bit where I ended up being 2,000 miles short of companion pass so you need a hundred
and thirty five thousand miles I had a hundred and thirty three thousand miles post in January
and I was like crap I have a trip in like a week and it was too late to put more spend on the card
because that spend wouldn't post until February and I needed to spend now so I did a bunch of
research and I've discovered which you know I think might be obvious to a lot of you already
is that Southwest has a shopping portal so similar to like Rakuten or Capital One Shopping or any of
these shopping portals you can earn Southwest miles which is a lot of money and you can earn
by purchasing things through their portal and their promotions and one of the promotions was
if you order HelloFresh you'll get 2,500 points and these points seem to post pretty quickly like
within a few days like the shopping portal tells you how quickly it posts and it listed it as like
within a week so I was like okay this could work but I also wasn't totally sure you know does
HelloFresh give you the points immediately or after your first order ships or they wait 30
days like none of that was really clear so to hedge my bets I also posted a bunch of things
and I also bought some stuff at Lululemon because Lululemon had a promo on the shopping portal where
you get five points per dollar so I just bought like $500 worth of Lululemon stuff and so for the
next week after making those purchases I was just daily checking my Southwest app to see if the
points had posted and they just didn't post you know it just kept not posting until the day of
the flight I'd already pretty much given up on the companion pass at this point and I'd already
booked my P2 and I'd already booked my P2 and I'd already booked my P2 and I'd already booked my P2
a $400 flight on Southwest and we were sitting in the parking shuttle like I parked my car and
we were taking the shuttle to the terminal and I opened the Southwest app and I just gave it like
one last check and the points had posted from HelloFresh and I had companion pass so now I'm
in the shuttle and my inner optimizer just totally kicked in where I had P2 open up Southwest on her
phone to cancel her flight and then on my phone I was going to quickly rebook a companion
pass on that flight because it looked like there was still a couple seats left and the cell service
was pretty crappy because we were inside a shuttle in the middle of nowhere at an airport and yeah in
the period about five minutes I was able to cancel hers and rebook her for free using my companion
pass and it literally saved $400 because that's $400 she didn't have to pay for her flight which
she'd already checked into by the way so she had to cancel her flight check-in and then recheck in
for a flight and get a crappy number of points and then I was able to cancel her flight check-in
on Southwest but it didn't matter because I could save a seat for her it was a whole thing
especially at like 5 a.m in the morning but you know the the curse of being an optimizer which
in this case I would say turned out to be a blessing I mean five minutes of work for $400
is probably worth optimizing for so I'm definitely counting that $400 in the tally this month because
we had already spent $400 so that was money that we'd committed that we got back
and also I ended up getting a
couple Southwest referrals one from my dad I'd gotten him to open the Southwest performance
business card as well that was a big win because that was his first foray into churning and he hit
the spend within three months completely organically because I'm like you know people
just spend $5,000 in three months and he was like wow that was really easy and I also referred him
to the personal premier card which gives you another 50,000 miles which he needed in order
to get companion pass because if you're not familiar with the companion pass you can get
the companion pass calculation it's you need 135,000 miles in one calendar year to get companion
pass for this year and the following year and they also give you a 10,000 point bonus for holding one
of the credit cards so you only actually need to get 125,000 points so if you open that personal
premier card that's 50,000 points and then you open the performance business for 80,000 points
that's 130,000 points right there and that's enough to get companion pass
in my case actually ended up being a little easier thanks to referring my dad because
I opened the performance card for 80,000 then I referred him to the performance card and the
personal premier card each of those referrals is worth 20,000 and referral points count towards
companion pass so I got 80,000 plus 20,000 plus 20,000 equals 120,000 then you're only 5,000
points short of companion pass which you can get just from spending money on the card
or doing a thing like lululemon or hellofresh through the shopping portal so it ended up being
a really great month for southwest points because I got the points I think ended up being about 125,000
southwest points plus got companion pass which is a great win and carries us forward for two years
of free flights for my wife another couple chase cards that we opened in January for my p2 I had
opened the chase inc unlimited card I'd been meaning to open it for a while
right when she was about to open the card offer dropped from 90,000 points for $6,000 of spend
to 75,000 points for $6,000 of spend which was a bit of a bummer but luckily I'd read data points
on doctor of credit where you could get matched to that 90,000 point offer still so that's what
I did for her I referred her to that 75,000 point offer so that I would get 40,000 points
she would get 75 sent a secure message saying hey there's a 90,000 point offer out there could you
do it got a confirmation that they would match once she's met the spend so once she's done with
the spend on that it ends up being 130,000 points total so 75k plus the 15k for the match plus the
40k for referring her and also right before that offer died the public offer I think went away on
January 18th or the 21st right before it died I also just yolo'd one more chase inc 75k offer
because I wanted to be able to match it and I wanted to be able to match it and I wanted to
match it to that 90k and yeah it was a success too I sent a secure message asking to match they
confirmed just meet the spend as well and so I'll also get 130,000 points from that ink card once I
finish my $6,000 of spend and it was sort of just the you know one last hurrah before the ink train
it's still alive you can still do these ink cards and get referral bonuses but they're not quite as
good as they were when there were 90,000 points but yeah glad to have squeezed in one more of
the cards and probably just going to take a little break from chase for a while let things kind of
cool down so nothing posted from those inks in January but in February I'm expecting like
260,000 chase points to post so definitely looking forward to that but in January I also
yolo'd a Amex business gold card right before the annual fee and the changes went into effect
on February 1st I think I did my Hail Mary application on January 31st
right before the increases in the annual fee so I think I locked in the $295 annual fee was
instantly approved and I wasn't expecting to be approved because if you've been listening to these
recaps I've been trying to open these Amex cards for a while I've been stuck in pop-up jail for
quite a while now where you get that pop-up saying hey you're not eligible for the sign-up bonus
because of your account history and yeah as early as like I think early January I tried to again get
business gold card and got the same pop-up but for whatever reason on January 31st when I tried
it let it through and yeah just really excited about that because I also was able to pull up
the increased 150,000 point offer using a VPN through Dallas and by searching American Express
Platinum on Google clicking that link in Safari and then browsing into the gold card from the
Amex Platinum page so a bit of a convoluted step but I was able to reliably pull up this offer
pretty much in January and I was able to pull up the Amex Platinum offer and I was able to pull up
every time and if you're not in the market for the business gold now that the fees increased I
think that 190,000 point platinum offer is still available through the VPN process and I'll link
to the great post by Miles Ernenburn that tipped me off to this process still working on spend for
this card though it's a pretty new card so nothing to report bonus wise for the January recap on that
but in terms of Amex stuff that did post in January I did get a $350 credit
as a retention offer on P2's Morgan Stanley Platinum card if you're not familiar with the
Morgan Stanley flavor I did an episode on it let me see I think it was episode 38 on how to open
this Morgan Stanley card the main benefit with the Morgan Stanley card is you get a free authorized
user so instead of paying $175 for the authorized user it's free and so I'm an authorized user on
there and it's great for things like lounge access because now Amex Platinum Centurion lounges require
one Amex Platinum per person trying to get into the lounge but anyhow the annual fee had come up
it was due again at $695 and I just used the Amex online chat you don't even have to call in
to ask what kind of offers there were you know as a retention offer and on the third and final offer
they offered $350 back if you spend $4,000 on the card and that was the highest retention offer I
could get I mean it's always a good practice when you ask for a retention offer and you're like oh
this is the best for these offers to just keep asking is there any other offers and then
eventually they'll just be like this is the best offer we have there are no other offers but
everyone's offers are gonna vary so I think the way they decide who gets what offer is just based
on how much money you've spent on the card how long you've had the card open all kinds of factors
but definitely worth asking for a retention offer before you just go out and cancel the card so in
January P2 got the 350 from that Morgan Stanley
Amex platinum retention then tallying up everything else as well there was the 235,000
Capital One miles 125,000 Southwest miles $400 from that Southwest discount for a total of
360,000 miles and $750 so pretty big month for credit cards I mean if you kind of just convert
that into cash those Capital One miles are worth one cent per point Southwest miles are worth about
$1.3 million so that's a pretty big month for credit cards I mean if you kind of just convert
that into cash those Capital One miles are worth about $1.3 million so that's a pretty big month for
point conservatively so that Capital One bonus of 235,000 points is worth $2,350 the Southwest
bonus of 125,000 points is worth $1,625 if you multiply by 1.3 plus the $750 from Southwest
bookings and Morgan Stanley the whole thing ends up being $4,725 just from credit card bonuses
in January P2 so that's a pretty big month for credit cards I mean if you kind of just convert
that into cash those Capital One miles are worth $1.3 million so pretty big month for credit cards
so really really great month when you look at it like that all right next up we have brokerages
pretty busy month in January for brokerages there was a couple big bonuses that I was focused on
from Robinhood and you know I know there's conflicting feelings out there about Robinhood
in fact there's a like a 12, 13, 14 page boggleheads thread about these bonuses and half
the people in the thread are just basically hating on Robinhood and the other half are like
this is an amazing offer like let's forget about the fact that it's Robinhood offering it for a
second but it's legitimately a good offer and I'm kind of in that camp as well because everything
ultimately is being insured by the SIPC so no matter how you feel about you know Robinhood's
ethics or their liquidity and their potential of being bankrupt or being bought out like it's sort
of not that relevant to the bonus itself because at worst
you'll be able to get your investments back from the SIPC assuming you're investing less than
$500,000 per account so I read the whole boggleheads thread I'll link to that in the show notes as well
but after reading it I felt pretty comfortable doing the bonus and so the first of the bonuses
is that Robinhood was giving a one percent match on any money that you transfer over into Robinhood
what was unique about this was that the one percent was uncapped so we've
seen better offers before I even did an episode I think episode 34 on public back when public was
offering $2,000 if you transfer in $100,000 of assets so that's like two percent right two percent
return is the bonus pretty good in the case of Robinhood it's only one percent but it's uncapped
you can transfer in as much as you want like there are jokes about well if I transfer in a billion
dollars Robinhood is going to give me ten million dollars in theory yes if anyone
has done that in practice I would love to hear the data point but if you're able to do that you're
probably not listening to a churning podcast but in our case you know we were planning on transferring
definitely less than $500,000 so the money would be SIPC insured and getting an extra one percent
return on the money transferred seemed like a great deal that's just basically an improvement
on your market return because remember you're transferring over stocks right assets that are
already invested in the market so this is an additional gain on that
money this isn't like you're transferring in $200,000 from a checking account and now you only
get a one percent bonus that wouldn't be a good deal because your $200,000 isn't earning anything
but if it's already in the market this is just like a sweetener on top the only requirement is
that you hold that money at Robinhood for two years if you don't want them to take any of that
bonus back which that was the part I was conflicted about because I do brokerage bonuses I you know
in a given year maybe move our funds three maybe
different places to get that bonus but one percent is pretty good and not having to do that
for a couple years yeah you know that's that's good that's time saved and not having to chase
other brokerage bonuses so it was sort of like a both a pro and a con that there was a two-year
holding period so I did that one right on the cutoff as well you just had to have initiated
the ACATS transfer by January 31st which is when the offer expired I think they bring this offer
back period by January 31st so I think they bring this offer back period by January 31st so I think
they bring this offer back periodically so even if you've missed it you know keep an eye out and
this might come back around the other Robinhood brokerage bonus which is still available and goes
through April 30th although I probably wouldn't wait till the last minute in case they do decide
to pull this one because it's a pretty crazy offer is that they're offering a three percent
match on any retirement funds that you transfer over to Robinhood so three percent is truly insane
like one percent you know it's a pretty crazy offer but it's a pretty crazy offer and it's a pretty crazy
you could be like okay you know sometimes there's better deals elsewhere three percent is the best
that I've ever seen for retirement funds usually you don't get bonuses on retirement funds most
brokerage offers are specifically for your taxable accounts they exclude retirement funds there's
some exceptions to that and when there is an exception I definitely tackle it like that
Wells Fargo $2,500 brokerage bonus last year that both P2 and I did that didn't exclude
retirement funds so we definitely moved our retirement funds over to Wells Fargo but that's
you know more the exception than the rule in the case of this Robinhood offer they're specifically
targeting retirement funds at three percent so if you read the boggleheads thread you know
people do the rough calculation well look you probably don't want to transfer more than
$500,000 because you want to be insured by SIPC and just keep in mind that SIPC 500k insurance
is per account so it's not per your entire Robinhood account so it's not per your entire
account so it's not per your entire Robinhood account so it's not per your entire Robinhood
account it's per account type that you open at Robinhood so you could have a Roth IRA account
you could have a traditional IRA account you could have a taxable account each one of those
is insured at 500k but the rough math is you know if you're able to move over 500k from a retirement
fund into Robinhood Robinhood will immediately post a $15,000 bonus that's three percent of
$500,000 that's pretty insane that's a massive bonus that they give you immediately
and it's like it's not like they're waiting till the holding period ends and that is the main
downside of this bonus is that there is a five-year holding period on your retirement funds but they
give you the bonus up front and if you dip below the amount that you transferred and the amount
that they gave you a bonus for they're gonna deduct it from either your cash balance or they'll
just take it via ACH from your linked bank account so there's no really getting around the five-year
rule the other less than ideal part with this
bonus is that Roth conversions are counted as you withdrawing out of the account which would
impact how much of the bonus you get so if you are doing Roth conversions and you convert let's
say I don't know 100k out of the account that's 100k less of the bonus that you're technically
eligible for and Robinhood will deduct that bonus amount even if you're converting into another
account at Robinhood so that's the kind of crappy annoying
and is making some people be like well I don't know if I want to do it and definitely that's
sort of our case too I just did an episode a couple episodes ago about Roth conversions and
so we're definitely planning on doing Roth conversions on my end though I'm just like I
think it's still worth it you know I don't know how much Roth conversions I'm gonna do in the
next five years and if Robinhood has to take some of the bonus away that's fine that's understandable
but in the off chance I don't convert that much it's a three percent bonus that I wouldn't have
gotten otherwise so I don't know how much I'm gonna do in the next five years and if Robinhood has to
otherwise like that's an extra 0.6 percent market return every year for five years I don't know of
any other promotion or brokerage that's offering that kind of an increased guaranteed return that
you receive up front so that's on my plate to do I have until April 30th there is of course some
risk that too many people do this and Robinhood pulls it early so if you're interested you may
want to get to it in the next few weeks or next month I'm going to try and knock that out in
February then there was another brokerage bonus that popped up on my radar that I was kind of
procrastinating on until a few days ago which is the M1 finance referral bonus that's where you get
$250 so each party the party being referred and the party referring gets $250 if you make a $10,000
deposit which in itself is not that great but the $10,000 only needs to stay in the account for 30
days and that's what makes it really hard to get that money back so I'm going to try and knock that
really great if you have $10,000 lying around parked somewhere else this could be a good place
to park for 30 days plus if you have a P2 that's really when things like get really good because
now you can also refer your P2 so if you get $250 for joining using a referral then you refer a P2
you get another $250 and your P2 gets $250 ends up being $750 for parking $20,000 in that case
for 30 days so a really easy bonus to tackle
and yeah it's a pretty nice website to use there it's pretty smooth I signed up pretty quickly
once you sign up you can open an invest account and then transfer cash into that invest account
the deposit I think showed up within a day and once the deposit shows up is when you can then
refer other people because I had to wait for that to be able to refer my P2 and at least the data
points I'm seeing on discord the bonus also posts pretty quickly like within a few days
the only mildly I guess annoying thing about
M1 is that you know their whole gimmick is pies and slices I feel like every brokerage now has to
have some kind of a gimmick to sort of stand out and M1 went with your portfolio is a pie and you
can pick slices so you don't invest in stocks you invest in slices and so that took me a minute just
to wrap my head around because I was just trying to buy SGOV that's where I tend to park cash when
it's doing a brokerage bonus because it earns interest and it's really easy to sell
and buy SGOV is just short-term treasury bonds and ETF for short-term treasury bonds so I was
trying to buy SGOV but instead I had to make one slice make a slice for SGOV and then invest the
10k into the pie which contains the one slice which I think then means it will be all invested
in SGOV but yeah it just just seemed unnecessarily complicated when I could just invest in stocks
directly but you know hey if it works for them good for them they're giving out referral bonuses
so can't really complain and yeah the $250 it is only available if you join via a referral
I used Couch's referral over on discord thank you Couch for sharing that one if you need one I'll
have mine up on the referrals page on the website if you end up using it definitely let me know
really appreciate it and I'll give you a shout out in the next episode finally on the brokerages
front I got a couple bonuses from Moomoo we all remember Moomoo right that was my churn of the
year last year because I made $15,000 and I got a couple bonuses from Moomoo and I got a couple
$15,000 from Moomoo but these bonuses were for transferring in assets so transferring in $3,000
into Moomoo they would give you $100 for doing that previously it was transfer $2,000 they'll
give you $100 the latest iteration is transfer in $10,000 they'll give you $100 I think they're
trying to test out how much people will transfer in $400 $3,000 is about the upper limit for me
and so I did that for both myself and P2
the only thing with the $100 is the way Moomoo pays out is it pays out in a coupon
that you redeem and the way to redeem coupons is to make a trade and the coupon usually has
the terms of the trade listed on the coupon so that was all pretty smooth both myself and P2
got the $100 but trying to get the money out of Moomoo they've unfortunately implemented some
additional hurdles and these hurdles are the ones that I've been using for the last year and I've
been using for the last year and I've been using for the last year and I've been using for the last year
these hurdles are designed to essentially stop you withdrawing money out of Moomoo so when I
initiated my withdrawal for $3,100 I got a text from Moomoo that was like we need to talk to you
about your withdrawal like it made it sound like there was an issue with my withdrawal and you
have to respond yes to the text message for them to continue talking to you about it turns out
this was a hundred percent just a marketing thing because the second I said yes I ended up over the
course of four hours getting four separate phone calls from four different numbers so four different
Moomoo reps every hour would call me and the voicemail they left was basically hey if you
cancel your withdrawal we'll give you five percent in a savings account or you know whatever Moomoo's
version is but they're just trying to incentivize you to not withdraw money out and of course I just
ignored all of that and it was fine the next day they stopped because that's when the withdrawal
would be too late to cancel by then but then I got a text from Moomoo that was like we need to
verify yourself before we can finalize your withdrawal keep in mind I've withdrawn a lot
of money out of Moomoo over the months and this has never happened before so this is a new thing
so this new thing is now you have to take a picture of the front and back of your ID
in the app upload it then do it the full selfie thing you know position your face
get closer get closer yep takes a picture of your selfie and that's when they finally got
finally released the funds luckily they at least verified pretty quickly like within an hour of
doing all of that they released the funds but here's where it gets extra annoying which is that
for P2 I also went into withdrawal and I'm like maybe it's because I try to take out three thousand
dollars let me just try taking out one thousand dollars maybe we can skip some of these steps
nope she still had to do the whole verification thing okay fine all right now let me take out
the remaining two thousand dollars oh she has to re-verify again so this verification
ID selfie step is every single time now that you withdraw even though they verified you before
and even though we've already withdrawn tens of thousands of dollars from Moomoo in the past
without having to do any of these steps so really a little bit disappointing to see Moomoo
take the path of implementing some of these more like shadow evil UI practices to try and get
people to not take their money out they're not quite as bad as some other firms I mean this just
be a trend now of using verification as an excuse to prevent you taking money out so case in point
Acorns another fintechy investment platform their whole thing is that even though you had five other
people join with the referral and you're supposed to be eligible for like a thousand dollar bonus
if we can't technically verify those five people that you signed up for then we don't have to give
you the bonus right and so that's sort of their play and there's been a lot of discussion
over on the discord about Acorns is basically just scamming you using their verification steps
you know they're not paying out these referral bonuses people are filing like CFPB complaints
and other things and so I'm glad Moomoo hasn't gone that far but it is a little troubling to
see that verification now is the new scam basically but in any case tallying up the
brokerage churns in January there's a lot of things in motion but in terms of the things
that I actually posted it was just those two
Moomoo transfer bonuses for $100 each for $200 total in brokerages in January
moving on to banks had a couple things that I'm working on with banks fidelity bloom if you have
that account from last year they had some signup bonuses if you still have those accounts they're
doing a 10% match if you deposit $300 and they seem to be doing that every year it keeps saying
it's going to expire this year but they keep extending it and so I did that for both myself
and P2 pretty easy one you know just deposit $300 and wait for the $30 mine hasn't posted yet so
hopefully that will post sometime in February in terms of things that did post for banks I got a
security plus $100 referral for referring my P2 and that was just paid out as a $100 Amazon gift
card I think they must have processed the whole batch at the end of January or early February
because I'm seeing a lot of data points on discord from folks getting their $100 and keep in mind
that email says
your $50 bonus but when you click it it's actually a $100 bonus so I guess that's one way to sort of
make people feel happy is to disappoint them and then surprise them immediately after I also got
some upgrade referrals so upgrade recently doubled their signup bonus if you join via referral from
$100 to $200 for the person joining and then it's still $50 for you know the person referring but
$200 is pretty good because the only requirement is that you
deposit $1,000 within 40 days to get $200 so a really great return but I think at this point most
people listening to the show have already signed up for it but if you haven't pretty easy one to
take advantage of I ended up getting five referrals in January for $250 I think it's a combination of
I also posted my referral link on the DOC referral thread definitely recommend always doing that when
you see one of those threads and then also some listeners from the show so if that was you big
thanks really appreciate it and I'll see you in the next one.
that because I ended up getting the $250 from upgrade plus $100 from security plus for a total
of $350 from banks in January and that $350 was entirely from referrals and I guess just a quick
tangent on referrals because I've had a couple comments from folks on the previous recap
one person suggested like hey you know maybe you don't want to include referrals in these recaps
maybe just hide those numbers or just leave them out or break them out
because otherwise your numbers are kind of skewed towards referrals and not everyone's getting a
whole lot of referrals like I get it you know definitely having a podcast about churning
helps to get referrals and most people don't have a podcast but that said I will say that like
referrals are such a big part of churning that I wouldn't want to like not include the referral
numbers in my tallies because I think the biggest thing if you're a solo player like you don't have
a player two you know you don't have a p2 a wife a spouse a partner is to go out there and get a p2 and
I don't mean that like get a romantic partner your p2 doesn't have to be someone that you're
romantically involved with it's just your player two for churning I know people who manage 10 plus
players they include relatives friends acquaintances colleagues like getting a p2 is
going to have such a big impact because so many of these offers
are referral only so being able to double or triple dip on a referral by referring each other
really is going to make you a lot of money but even outside of having a p2 which is definitely
the the easiest route there are other ways of getting referral bonuses you know doc posts
referral threads doctor of credit posts referral threads for most of these referral bonuses
so I post my referral link on there whenever I see one that was one of my main ways of getting
referrals prior to the referral process so I'm going to go ahead and get a p2 and I'm going to
obviously having a podcast doc referral threads reddit has the churning referrals subreddit you
can post on there our deals discord also has a referrals channel where you can share and request
referrals so there are a variety of options out there to get referrals if you're willing to be a
little proactive you know they're not just gonna come to you you have to go out there and seek
them and so that would be kind of my homework to you if you're doing the whole churning thing
solo and you're not getting any referral bonuses is to go out there and you know try and convince
someone to be your p2 it doesn't have to be a romantic thing or if that just is just like
absolutely you don't want to do that use some of these places that I mentioned to share your link
you know post it there because I think doing some of these things is going to have a way bigger
impact to your overall churning game than just doing one of these bonuses that I mentioned
in the recap so that was my quick uh tangent two cents on referrals
and churning which is that referrals are a pretty big part of churning if you're not doing them
you're kind of missing out a little bit you don't need a podcast to get referrals but getting back
to the recap we're gonna do cell phones next because January amazing month for cell phones
the big thing that happened in cell phone land in January for myself and p2 was that our t-mobile
keep and switch $800 rebates posted for both of us
so $1,600 total if you have no idea what I'm talking about I posted a deal for this
I think the title was almost free iPhone 15 pros a few months ago I think back in September you
can go to the daily churn podcast.com slash deals to see it you do need to be subscribed
to deals in order to get access to it but I may just make it into its own dedicated episode
in the future because it was really smooth like I didn't want to make it into a podcast
like an episode about it and then have it not work but I've fully vetted it now along
with a lot of people in the deals discord we're all getting our bonuses that $1,600 from t-mobile
came in the form of a prepaid card that you can choose to have deposited straight into
your bank account I didn't know better and I put it into cash app and then we drew it
that way but you don't even need to go through that step they're literally just going to
give you a $1,600 in essentially cash for doing the keep and switch program quick
tldr is you know t-mobile is going to pay you $800 per phone to move over to t-mobile
but you don't have to keep your service at t-mobile once they give you the money you
can just cancel t-mobile so that's kind of the the deal in a nutshell but if you need
more guidance and more details check out the post it's still live and kicking my p2 and
I initiated it back in September when the iPhone 15s came out and it took about four
months end-to-end to get it to work so I'm really excited about it and I'm going to
get the bonus but the program has been around since I think 2020 my friend was the one who
first tipped me off to this that he's like hey you know I'm getting a free iPhone every
year and this is how you do it and yeah it's been around for four plus years now so I feel
like it's probably going to stick around for a while which is why I'm a little more comfortable
sharing it publicly with you guys but definitely an amazing deal ended up getting $1,600 from
t-mobile in January in other cell phone news both myself and p2
got a $26 check from Apple for the Apple replacement device lawsuit settlement bit
of a mouthful both got that I don't even remember when we filed for that settlement
I think it was something to do with like getting a refurb unit when you return or
replace something under warranty in any case we both got $26 for an easy $52 but on the topic
of settlements Verizon also sent out an email about the Verizon post paid
class action settlement which I think is something about Verizon overcharging you something on the
Verizon bill so both myself and p2 ended up filling out that form I don't know when it's going to
post I think you have until April to fill it out so if you've had Verizon service sometime in the
last decade ish you could be eligible and it's always worth filling out these settlement things
because sometimes it's a dollar but sometimes it's like a hundred dollars like you never know
and it only takes a minute of your time and I ended up being eligible both myself and p2
because well we got Verizon service temporarily just to do the T-mobile keep and switch deal
and so we became eligible I think that means we're not going to get much money because we only had
Verizon service for a few months before we switched over to T-mobile but again I'll post a link to it
in the show notes see if you're eligible fill it out maybe you'll get a bigger check than we'll get
but tallying everything up from cell phones in January it was a $1,600 from T-mobile and $52
from Verizon for $25.
total of $1,652. Finally, we have meal kits. So I've been getting back into the meal kits game.
I, you know, I did an episode of meal kits. It was one of the first episodes I did, I think episode
two or three. And for a good year or so, we were eating meal kits every day. I have like hundreds
of meal kit recipe sheets, the papers they send you, stacked, like it's two feet high, you know,
because I was like, maybe I'll cook these recipes again in the future. So we kept them all. So I was
going pretty hard on meal kits for a while, but last year really kind of took a break from them
because we're like, Hey, let's just do some more of our own cooking. And that's been great. But
they got me back again this year because they sent a mailer. So HelloFresh will periodically send
these comeback offer mailers. And you got to keep an eye out because there's so many different
permutations of the comeback offer, but there's one specific one that's really good. And it comes
in the form of just a flyer. It's not one of those that comes in a little padded,
envelope with a little business card type deal. This HelloFresh one comes in just like a
rectangular sheet, like a little flyer. And those ones are 75% off of the first box. If you come
back and reactivate, and these are the best offers because 75% off of a box is better than a free box
because a free box, often those codes limit you to how much you can put in that free box. It'd be
three meals or two meals for two or three people. But the 75%,
are unlimited. You can pack that box to the brim and packing a box to the brim means putting six
meals for four people into one box. So essentially 24 meals and it's a $200 box. But because you have
a 75% offer, you only pay $50 instead of $200. So $50 for 24 meals is a really good deal. Even by
the lean fire subreddit standards, I think, what is that? $2 a meal? That's pretty reasonable.
For a pretty good meal too, like it includes meat and all this stuff. And HelloFresh is one of our
favorite meal kit services. But in our case in January, it ended up being even better than that,
which is that they messed up and sent that box twice. So in the period of like two days,
we received two of those boxes. So instead of six meals for four people, 12 meals for four people.
So instead of 24 meals, we got 48 meals for just two people, for just me and my wife. And it was
actually...
A little overkill because now you have to cook all of those meals before they go bad. It was like,
have you ever played that game Overcooked? It's like Overcooked, but in real life. So we ended
up actually just freezing a lot of the food. But basically these last few weeks have just been
nonstop HelloFresh cooking. And I think I may have to take another meal kit break unless they
send another one of these offers, which you can't say no to these offers. But the pro tip, I guess
the shitty life pro tip that I'm going to share with you with HelloFresh,
if you end up ordering this much food, is that cooking for eight people, cooking the same recipe
for eight people is about the same effort as cooking that recipe for two people. So what we
ended up doing was we not only doubled the HelloFresh recipe, but because we got two boxes
duplicate, we quadrupled the HelloFresh recipes. And so we would just cook for eight each time we
made one of these recipes and then just refrigerate the leftovers and just eat that for the next few
meals. So...
It's been a fun month of HelloFresh, but I'm going to count the discount this time. Usually I don't
count my meal kit discounts as like earnings because, you know, I wouldn't have paid full
price. But in this case, I think I'm going to count $150 because that's how much we saved on
one of these boxes. And we got two of those boxes. And so we saved at least $150 in Costco and Whole
Foods shopping by just eating HelloFresh for a few weeks. And on the topic of HelloFresh, I'm also
going to count the shopping costs. So I'm going to count the shopping costs. So I'm going to count
the shopping portal, the Southwest shopping portal miles that I got from ordering HelloFresh
through the Southwest shopping portals, 2,500 miles as like a promotional thing. And, you know,
if you remember from earlier in the episode, that's how we got our companion pass. And I do
have those miles now in my account. And, you know, that whole shopping portal thing, it's a pretty
interesting thing because you could potentially just earn companion pass using just the shopping
portal. And it's not just with Southwest. Every airline has their own shopping portal. And I'm
and so there are, you know, accounts and data points of people getting status through the
shopping portals. If you can find enough things to buy at a good enough deal, but tallying up the
meal kit stuff, it was the 150 in discounts from those two boxes plus 2,500 Southwest points,
which is worth about $33. Then tallying up all the churns from January, starting with credit cards,
there was that $360,000. And then there was the $350,000. And then there was the $350,000. And then
there was the $350,000 points from Southwest and Capital One plus $700 from Southwest and Morgan
Stanley. Brokerages, $200 from Moo Moo. Banks, $350 from Security Plus and upgrade referrals.
Cell phones, $1,652 from T-Mobile and the Verizon settlement. Meal kits, the 150 from HelloFresh
and 2,500 Southwest points for a total of $3,052 plus $362,000.
Pretty massive month, especially for the beginning of the year. My goal is still the same,
just to make $1,000 each month churning. And that blew it out of the water. I mean,
if we just convert that real quick into the cash equivalent, instead of just, you know,
tracking points and cash separately, if we just made those points cash at their bare minimum value,
we would end up with $7,110 total in cash and cash equivalents just from churning in one month,
and only $1,000 of that was from referrals. So the bulk of it, $6,000 of that was just for me
going out there and churning. So if you're feeling a little down about like not having a bunch of
referrals or not having a P2, you can still get pretty far just as a solo churner. So hopefully
that motivates you a little bit to just go out there and do some churning. And for me,
I'm going to try and take it a little easier in February because,
January was a pretty crazy month, like even just outside of churning, which I try and keep to under
20 hours a week. But the rest of the time was just spent researching and booking those flights and
trying out all of the new tools that are out there now, like seats.aero, point.me, maxmyrewards,
all those things. And maybe I'll document this whole process actually in an episode
in the future. But yeah, I'm ready for Feb to be just a little more chill. But in the meantime,
if you want to...
To stay up to date on what it is I am churning in February, definitely check out the live churn
tracker because I post everything I churn in real time there and keep that pretty up to date.
There's also a deals discord that I mentioned a few times in the episode. It is a private paid
discord where we talk about a lot of the deals that are a little too sensitive to be shared
publicly on the podcast with a few thousand listeners. So definitely check it out if you've
been looking to kind of up your churning game a bit and be a part of it.
That's quite positive and helpful and I think pretty unique in the churning space. I think just
a big shout out to everyone who joined in the last few weeks for not just supporting the show,
but also for kind of embracing that vibe and helping to perpetuate it and keep it as positive
and helpful as it is. And yeah, if you're new to the discord, I just posted a discord recap,
a best of discord of 2023 in January to kind of help you get up to,
because I know it is a lot. It's a bit of a fire hose sometimes. So I've curated some of the best
comments and posts. Apologies if I missed one of yours. I try and read everything in the discord,
but I do miss some things occasionally as well. But yeah, check it out. It's a pretty big post
with a lot of useful stuff in there. And going forward, I plan to send out one of these monthly
discord recaps each month for those of you that, you know, aren't able to just be on discord 24 7.
So yeah.
You can find all of that online at the daily churn podcast.com. Otherwise I will catch you
all in a couple of weeks for another episode. Thanks again for tuning in. See ya.
