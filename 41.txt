but recently have started dabbling into the carrying a balance strategy with these ink cards
and i know carrying a balance to a lot of us is like a bad word and for me too because my
friends told me about this strategy like a year ago and i was pretty dismissive of it i was like
i don't carry a balance like i don't want to affect my credit score and all this stuff and
i had such negative connotations of carrying a balance but it turns out with these ink cards
it's actually a really good strategy because with the ink
hey everyone welcome back to episode 41 of the daily churn
today's episode is going to be a recap of all of the things that i churned in march february and
january so a full quarter one recap and that's because quarter one was kind of a weird month
between vacation and getting sick and also just spending a ton of time doing taxes which
as a churner tax season is always a bit of a pain but things are starting to ramp back up now yeah
there was actually quite a few things surprisingly there are banks and brokerages credit cards some
meal kits cell phones a bunch of freebies and discounts so really a little bit of everything
so i think it should be a pretty packed episode but before we get into it just a quick reminder
that everything that we cover today will be in the show notes which you can find on the
dailychurnpodcast.com there's also a tracker there which has all of these things as well
that i've churned along with notes and data points and all that good stuff and now that
tracker should be fully up to date i kind of fell behind for a bit there but things are looking good
it's in good shape now so check it out if you haven't yet but for now let's dive right into
banks starting with huntington so huntington posted for both myself and p2 their personal
checking account and i'm going to be talking about their personal checking account and i'm going to
giving a six hundred dollar bonus if you go in branch and open it and deposit i want to say it
was twenty or twenty five thousand dollars but the nice thing with huntington is that that deposit
is cumulative so you don't have to do it in one go and you don't have to leave the money there
so what we did was we just sent twenty five thousand over and then we drew it a couple
days later and i think right on the 90 day mark from when we opened the account it posted for
both my p2 and i in february for six hundred dollars times two so twelve hundred
dollars total so definitely a very nice bonus then right after it posted we did their online
chat to downgrade the account from a paid account which is the one you had to open to qualify for
the bonus to their free account and i have a reminder to close those accounts too because
with huntington it's one of those accounts that you can pretty reliably churn every year so
definitely want to make sure the accounts are closed eventually so that you can do it again
the following year there was also live oak which was a business checking account that
i opened for both myself and p2 and that was a three hundred dollar bonus for depositing i think
only twenty five hundred dollars and making fifteen transactions so pretty easy the only
downside was it took like four or five months for it to post so it finally posted in february
of this year even though we'd opened it back in early october of last year but it posted three
hundred dollars times two so six hundred dollars total next up we have laurel road which is a i
think a subsidiary of key bank because you use the same login to log in and it's a very
simple way to log in and it's a very simple way to log in and it's a very simple way to log in
and we did this bonus last year and it was a unique bonus because you got the initial bonus up front
but every month after if you keep depositing twenty five hundred dollars you continue to get
twenty dollars into your account for free and so what we ended up doing was i just had ally
automate a twenty five hundred dollar in and out each month so it goes in and the very next day
comes right back out and i don't have to do anything it's completely hands off and so each
month both myself and my p2 get twenty dollars from laurel road so it's a very simple way to
over the three months of quarter one gave us a hundred and twenty dollars for not really having
to do much i guess you lose a little bit of interest while the money moves but i think the
twenty dollars more than makes up for it we also had some dcu credit union referrals come in and so
that was a bank bonus that i did back in i think december but their referral program is you get
fifty dollars the person you refer gets fifty dollars and so in january four folks joined in
february three people joined and they were able to get fifty dollars and so we had a lot of
in march two people joined so a total of nine referrals for a total of four hundred and fifty
dollars from dcu so if you're one of those people that use my dcu referral really appreciate it
it's always a nice surprise particularly when like you're in bed sick but now that i'm fully
recovered i've also been getting back into doing some of these bank bonuses including ones that
require me to go in branch and so the big one that we just did on april 1st so technically
april but we can talk about it now because they actually extended the offer is that wells fargo
twenty five hundred dollar bonus for opening a premier checking account and moving two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars worth of assets over to wells fargo and so usually that's a non-starter
for us because two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of assets is a lot like we'd have to
compile all of our brokerages together and transfer them all over but in the case of wells fargo they
have not excluded iris and that's unusual because most banks with brokerage bonuses will exclude
iris and i'm not sure
what the rationale is for excluding maybe they don't make as much money on trades with iris as
they do with regular brokerage accounts but typically they're excluded but not in the case
of this wells fargo one and so that was immediately appealing to us because my wife has a 401k at
vanguard that sort of just sits there and usually we can't earn any bonuses on it so we were pretty
excited about this offer particularly after seeing chuck post on doc about his experience opening it
and there were a lot of useful comments there from other people's data points that it
sounded like it was going to be pretty smooth so we went ahead and booked an appointment for the day
that the offer is expiring so you had to go online to wells fargo generate the promo code and you had
to bring that promo code in branch because that premier checking account is like their i guess
their premium checking account similar to chase private client type things and so they want you
to go in branch to do it and so we had our appointment booked for april 1st which is the
day that offer was expiring which turned out to be a good decision because when we showed up there
were 20 25 people in the lobby waiting to see a banker because april 1st was a saturday so if you
do wells fargo offers in the future just make sure you book an appointment particularly on the weekends
because a lot of those 20 25 people were getting turned away because they only had two bankers
on a saturday morning but all in all it was a very smooth process took about 30 minutes for them to
open my p2s premier checking account and then when we went home we opened the wells trade ira account
which is their brokerage side of things and so if you were just transferring stocks you can open a
wells trade brokerage account since we're moving in ira we're opening a wells trade ira and that
was super easy to do online and now we're just in the process of doing a 401k rollover from vanguard
into wells trade and so that's probably actually the most painful process because it is very manual
but overall i think the time spent is well worth potentially twenty five hundred dollars and the
thing with this offer is that they've actually extended it to july 1st so if you didn't get a
chance to do it before you now have until july 1st to go online and generate that code on our end
once i think p2s transfer and stuff goes through i might do it for myself since now i have until
july 1st because all of my brokerage money is locked up with public currently so public was
another brokerage bonus that was really lucrative i think it's like two thousand dollars for bringing
in a hundred thousand dollars of assets and i did an episode on that a few months back as well but
my
funds are locked with public for six months and so april 1st was too soon for me to transfer money
out of public but now that it's july 1st all the public funds are free so i think i'll be able to
qualify for it too but yeah i'll keep you guys posted and i'll post the link to this offer as
well in the show notes if you want to check it out and as well as chuck's post and the doc post
super helpful with a lot of data points there one nice thing too about opening these kinds
of checking accounts in branch is that they don't run checks in branch
that's not true for every bank but at least the big ones like wells fargo chase huntington they
don't run checks and so i get a lot of questions sometimes from folks like how do you open so many
accounts your checks history must look crazy i'm at like 12 in the last four months and i'm getting
denied left and right well these in branch ones are actually sort of a workaround to that as well
where they don't run checks so it's all good how many you have because no one's going to question
you about it and if you're not sure what your check status is there's actually a website where
you can just generate your check status and you can just generate your check status and you can
free checks reports so you can see exactly what inquiries are showing up there and i got that link
from maddie who listens to the show thanks maddie for that link and i'll post that in the show notes
as well tallying up the banks we've got the twelve hundred dollars from huntington six hundred dollars
from live oak 120 from laurel and 450 from dcu for a total of two thousand three hundred and seventy
dollars from banks in q1 next up sort of on the the topic of brokerages one i just signed up for
today
literally like a couple hours ago is moomoo invest so doc just posted about that i think today or
yesterday um but the offer only goes until april 30th so i figured i'd mention it now in case
anyone wanted to get in on it which is that they're giving you 15 free stocks when you join
moomoo invest and so if you're someone who likes doing these app brokerages where they give you
free stocks which i do i've done all the ones like robin hood and first trade and weeble 15 free
stocks is actually pretty good and i think it's a good way to get in on it and i think it's a good
they value them at three dollars minimum up to i think a hundred dollars i mean i would just go in
with the assumption that you're only going to get three dollars per stock so 15 of those is 45
dollars for like two minutes of work signing up so for me the the effort and cost is worth it but
i know some people are like i don't like giving my social security number out all the time to these
little things and i guess like my argument in my head is that as a churner i've signed up for
hundreds of different things that have my social
security number plus pretty much every mainstream company like home depot target department of
labor like they've all been hacked your social security number is guaranteed already in a file
somewhere on some hacker's computer so just me personally i'm not that protective over my social
security number but you know i totally get it if you are and this isn't the kind of bonus that you
want to tackle but for us 45 is nice and i was reading the comments on doc and sean actually
brought up a pretty interesting point which is right now
if you refer someone you get two bank of america stock so bac and those are trading for like
27 right now so essentially 50 worth of bac stock for referring so if you have a p2 this turns into
a much better offer because you can refer p2 you get 50 worth of bac stock plus you get 15 free
stocks and your p2 gets 15 free stocks so 30 free stocks total so if you add that up it's like 50
plus the 45 plus 45 so almost 150
between two people and because it's an app brokerage they also don't run your checks so
for me it's kind of a win-win but you do have to keep in mind that part of the qualification
is you do need to deposit a thousand dollars with them to get those 15 free stocks so you do lock
up your thousand dollars for i think 60 days but they are spic insured so even if you're worried
about the bank going under it should in theory still be fine like you'll be made whole by the
government but you know again understandably people are also a little wary of the fact that
this kind of stuff after the silicon valley bank fiasco so anyways thought i share the offer for 15
free stocks goes until april 30th so if you're interested check it out my referral link is also
on the website at the daily churn podcast.com slash referrals really appreciate it if you end
up using mine moving right on to credit cards i mean the big news of credit cards in the last
month of course was the uh the chase inc gravy train finally coming to an end sort of i mean it
hasn't come to an end because now if you have a p2 i think it's actually more lucrative than it used
to be but if you don't have a p2 they have reduced the bonus from 90 000 points down to 75 000 points
and that was supposed to officially end i think on march 21st like march 21st was supposed to be
the last day but they ended up pulling it like eight hours ish early and i know this because
i was on a facetime call with two of my friends getting them to sign up for this offer because
they've been kind of you know dilly-dallying
a little bit for the last year that i've been telling them like hey this is an amazing offer
you should do it and finally i was like guys let's get on facetime because this offer expires today
so we're gonna do it today and i'm gonna walk you through exactly how to do it and as we were on the
call pulling up the offer the offer dropped down to 75 000 and i was like god damn it but luckily
it wasn't the end of the world they still ended up applying because what chase did when they
bumped the offer down from 90 to 75 was they also increased
referrals from 20 000 to 40 000 so they doubled the amount of points you get from referrals so if
you kind of just do the math quickly it used to be 20 000 points to the referrer plus 90 000 points
to you for 110 000 points total now it's 40 000 points to the referrer and 75 000 points to you
for 115 000 points total so it actually went up by 5 000 points and so i just offered to split my
referral with them to make up for the difference so i just offered to split my referral with them
if you have a p2 it's kind of a win-win all around with my p2 i actually referred her about a week
before the cutoff and referrals were already at that point showing only the 75 000 point offer
but they were accepting bonus matches over secure message so i applied for my p2 at the 75 000 point
offer where she gets 75 000 i get 40 000 then i secure message chase to match to the 90 000 point
offer which was still going on at the time and they confirmed that they were able to match my
so after she meets her six thousand dollars of spend we're going to end up getting 130 000 points
total from the one card probably won't get that bonus until april or may but the ones that did
post in quarter one was that i got a chase inc unlimited that posted for myself for 90 000 points
plus 9 000 points from spend in january then in february my chase inc cash 90 000 points plus
6 000 spend posted then in march my
p2's chase inc unlimited 90 000 bonus plus 9 000 spend posted for a total of 294 000 chase points
that posted in quarter one so a massive amount of points but on top of that i also had some
referrals come in in january i had one referral post for 20 000 in february i had three referrals
post or 60 000 total so thanks maddie and my p2 and other listeners for using those and in march
i had one so another
20 000 for a total of 100 000 chase points in referrals in quarter one so adding those together
the 294 plus 100 ends up being 394 000 chase points in q1 so really great month on the points
front and you know if you have a p2 now's an even better time to jump on the chase inc gravy train
that has just restarted if you don't have a p2 i also have my inc referral links on the website as
well if you want to use that if you're not sure how to meet the spend for the
p2 you can use the link in the description of this video and i'll see you in the next one
thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next one
both myself and p2 are not eligible for that bonus because with us bank you need to have a
two-year gap between when you last closed that account so a two-year gap from closure date so
that's kind of brutal and we weren't eligible but if you are i believe that offer expires on
april 11th which is a tuesday which is the day this podcast comes out so if that's you highly
recommend jumping on the us bank offer and comboing that with the chase inc knocking out half your
spend and yeah very jealous
one last thing i'll say about the chase inc cards is that i thought i had a pretty good system going
for it but recently have started dabbling into the carrying a balance strategy with these inc cards
and i know carrying a balance to a lot of us is like a bad word and for me too because my
friend told me about this strategy like a year ago and i was pretty dismissive of it i was like
i don't carry a balance like i don't want to affect my credit score and all this stuff and
i had such negative connotations of carrying a balance
but it turned out to be a pretty good strategy and i think that's a good thing
turns out with these inc cards it's actually a really good strategy because with the inc cards
they give you zero percent apr for 12 months and what that effectively means is that if you have
let's say a credit limit of ten thousand dollars you're essentially getting a ten thousand dollar
loan from chase for free and that ten thousand dollars you can use to do things like get that
us bank bonus or put it into a high yield cd or really any checking or saving account at this
point because everything is returning like five percent currently so if you put ten thousand dollars
into a five percent interest account you're going to make five hundred dollars in interest in that
year while chase charges you zero percent interest so it's sort of like a bank bonus in that sense
but the way you do it is by carrying a balance and so it took a little while for me to be convinced
that like this is a good thing to do and doc actually recently posted a list of cards that
have zero percent apr as their introductory rate and so after reading through that post and just
thinking about it some more i'm like yeah i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it
i'm like yeah this is kind of a a no-brainer to do i should have been doing this all along with my
cards but the the biggest concern i had was just from a credit score perspective like i always
thought carrying a balance was bad but from everything i've read online it seems that
carrying a balance doesn't impact your credit score at all if you keep your credit to debt
ratio low so if you only have let's say ten thousand dollars worth of credit limit across
all of your cards and you carry a ten thousand dollar balance yes that's going to
negatively affect your credit score however if you have let's say over a hundred thousand dollars
of credit across all of your cards and you carry a ten thousand dollar balance then that's a ten
percent ratio and that's okay that's really not going to affect your credit score that much the
main impact you'll see is that chase themselves may not want to approve you for more cards so if
chase sees that you're carrying a balance with chase they're like i don't think i want to approve
you for another chase inc card so if you're on the chase inc gravy train
and you want to keep applying for more chase inc cards you probably shouldn't carry a balance but
if you're taking a break like we are then carrying balance doesn't really matter and can actually make
you some money in the long term some people go even harder than this which is that you carry a
balance for 12 months and then when the 12 months ends instead of paying off the balance you can
just transfer that balance to another card that's doing a promotional 12 months of zero percent apr
so that debt kind of just shifts around indefinitely and you get
free money to do with what you will like earn five percent interest so doc did a great post on that
pretty recently the zero percent apr post which i'll link to in the show notes if that's something
you're interested in but yeah it's something that we just started dabbling in and should make us an
extra five hundred dollars thanks to money that chase has loaned us for free on the chase front
i also opened the ihg card which is the branded credit card for the ihg hotel chain they were
offering a hundred and seventy five thousand
ihg points for only three thousand dollars of spend so we don't really do a lot of stays at ihg
i've always been more of a hyatt guy but ihg's portfolio includes hotels like the kimpton
and six senses and there's actually a couple kimtons in the city near us and the rates are
actually pretty good for points it's anywhere from 30 to 40 000 points a night so at 175 000
points for the bonus plus another probably 10 15 000 from spend you're looking at like 180 190
000 isg points so that's a pretty good point so if you're looking at a hundred and ninety thousand
points for doing this offer which equals four to six nights free at one of these kimtons for us
which is a really good deal and ihg i think does the fourth night free as well when you use points
so yeah it can turn into quite a few free kimpton nights and if you haven't stayed at the kimpton
they're actually quite nice so i needed another card for spend and ihg to me was worth burning a
524 slot for because this is a personal card not a business card tallying up the credit card stuff
a lot of things in motion but in terms of actual things like the credit card stuff it's a lot of
things posting it was just at 394 000 ultimate reward points in q1 moving right along we have
meal kits meal kits we've sort of backed off a little bit in q1 just with vacation and stuff
we haven't been getting them every week like we used to for the last few years since the pandemic
but one offer that we always do consistently when we get it is the 75 off hello fresh reactivation
offer and that's a really really great offer that we get periodically from accounts that we've
sold at hello fresh and what it is is you get 75 off of your first box and that turns into a
really good deal because hello fresh will now let you put eight meals into one box it used to be
capped at six they recently upped it to eight probably because they're like why would we not
sell you more meals if you think you can cook them but eight meals in one box usually goes for
like 150 with 75 off we end up getting it for 36 for eight meals which ends up being under five
dollars per meal which is
sort of our goal for meals since we're doing the whole lean fire thing and so we got one of those
i think in february or march and so we had a box come in got another one of those offers in the
mail for my p2s accounts or about to do that one too one thing i did notice with these new boxes
that we've been getting from hello fresh is that they've gotten stingier with how many of those
free hello fresh box codes they put in there they used to put anywhere from three to five
in a box and now it's down to just one so we have one hello fresh free box code that we've gotten
so if anyone hasn't tried hello fresh yet and wants to give it a go so that they can join get a free
box cancel and then start getting these 75 reactivation offers let me know in the comments
sadly yeah only have the one hello fresh code to share this time next up we have cell phones so my
p2 and i have been on mint mobile ever since we switched during black friday when they were doing
the buy three get three deal and we moved over from visible and the big news with mint is that
t-mobile has a free box so if anyone hasn't tried hello fresh yet and wants to give it a go so that
fully acquired mint so mint was always on the t-mobile network but now t-mobile also just owns
mint similar to how verizon owns visible and yeah it's overall been pretty positive because i just
got an email the other day where they've just upped the data cap for every single plan and so
our four gigabyte plan is now five gigabytes for free i think if you're on the like 15 gigabytes
you're now at 20 gigabytes for free so i think that was a result of the t-mobile sale they were
probably just trying to make everyone happy and they were just trying to make everyone happy
and it worked and so yeah we're pretty happy with mint and we got some referrals in january and
february from folks who joined so thanks for doing that hopefully you guys are liking mint as well and
just tallying it up let's see there were three referrals in january one for sixty dollars one
for ninety dollars one for a hundred dollars because the way mint referrals work is it's
based on the tier plan that the person you refer joins so if they join a bigger plan you get a
bigger referral bonus and they were also running this other promo at the same time where if someone
from verizon or at&t joins mint you get a hundred dollar referral bonus and it turns out that
visible was also triggering that bonus because i guess since visible is owned by verizon they were
for some reason counting it then in february a couple people joined as well for 45 and 45 so
another 90 bucks so adding all of that up it was 340 dollars in mint referrals in q1 so yeah super
appreciative of that because that basically covers a year's worth of money so yeah so
that's it for this video i hope you guys enjoyed it and i'll see you guys in the next one bye
flavors now there's the credit card the debit card and they've recently added a reloadable like a
prepaid card and so each of those cards when you sign up you'll get a 40 target coupon which is
essentially like a 40 target gift card to take 40 off of your purchase and the good thing with
this coupon is that you can use it once online and once in store so really it's 80 now of course
the target you don't want to apply for the credit card because that's going to be a credit inquiry
but the debit card and the reloadable card has zero impact and so you're able to churn those
you're able to close those and reopen them every 90 days at least with a debit card the reloadable
card is still pretty new so people aren't sure exactly what the time frame is but basically every
three months or so target will run this offer where you get that 40 coupon and the three month
time frame times pretty well with the 90 day churning time frame it's like they know and they
want to sync the two up and so in january i opened the 90 day churning time frame and i opened the
a debit card for myself because the previous one i had opened in october i'd closed and was now
past that 90 day timer and p2 opened the reloadable for the first time and was approved i also tried
opening the reloadable but didn't get approved probably because the reloadable is run by the
same company that runs bluebird and serve which i was shut down from so they were i think just like
we're not approving this guy for more reloadable cards but p2 was able to get one so we got a 40
coupon for me
and a 40 coupon for her and you can use that twice once online once in store for 80 per person
for a total of 160 in free target money in january then in march the offer came around again and p2
was now eligible for a new debit card because it'd been 90 days since she'd last opened her
previous one and so she was approved for that so another 40 coupon equals 80 at target then
yesterday in early april i just applied for another debit card for her and she was able to
get one for me because my previous one from january had now been closed and it'd be 90 days
and i just got approved for that one too but i won't count that one yet i'll count that in the
april one so it was just the 160 in january and then 80 in march for a total of 240 in target
money in q1 i also did another round of the amex amazon offer where you spend one amex points and
you get 30 off of your amazon order up to a hundred dollars so you essentially get 30 off at amazon
and i seem to be retargeted for these offers every two three months it feels like and yeah in
march i was targeted again and we just got another 30 bucks free at amazon the other interesting thing
with amazon that i discovered recently was that you can link your hilton accounts your hilton
loyalty points to amazon and pay with hilton points now the the ratio isn't that good but i
had 10 000 hilton points expiring my p2 also had 10 000 hilton points expiring we'd gotten those
free
from some promo a while back and we don't really stay at hilton so we had that sitting in our
account and it was expiring and i was like googling ways to just use it up or extend the
expiration and it turns out that yeah you could just use it to pay for stuff on amazon and 10 000
hilton points is equal to 20 on amazon so not the best redemption ratio but the points that
were expiring anyway that i got for free it was still free money on amazon so i did that for both
myself and p2 for a total of forty dollars finally
on the freebies and discounts front we have the crazy wendy's deal that happened right at the end
of march so if you're on slick deals or you may have even seen it on doc wendy's tweeted that
they were offering thirty dollars off of any order on wendy's when you order through doordash
if you use the code biggie and people were like replying on twitter being like did you mean to
say thirty dollars or three dollars and wendy was like no we said it right it's thirty dollars and
it was only if you ordered on doordash on march thirtieth or march thirty first between six and
seven p.m eastern time so only during that one hour window and if you order during that one hour
window and you add a biggie bag which is i think what they were trying to promote with this
promotion biggie bag is sort of just like a meal but if you include a biggie bag in your order
you'll get thirty dollars off your entire order and delivery is free it covers tax the only thing
it doesn't cover is tip
and as you can imagine like the internet went insane there's like hundreds of pages of comments
i think on slick deals about people redeeming this offer and as you might have guessed doordash was
not built for the volume of traffic that was coming in so the doordash app and the website
were literally crashing during that one hour window it was like doordash was getting ddos
by people just trying to get free food and yeah we did it on march thirty first
and it took like twenty minutes of refreshing the page and trying to apply this promotion which
kept throwing different errors each time you clicked it like the whole thing was a total mess
but eventually it went through and yeah we were able to get thirty dollars of wendy's food for
just five dollars which was the tip honestly the challenge really was trying to figure out how to
even get your order to thirty dollars because thirty dollars at wendy's for two people even
with the markups at doordash is a ton of food i mean it was like two full
meals with frosties with cookies and a salad on top like it was a lot of stuff but i'm glad we
were able to get it through and honestly i think the only people who lost on this offer were as
always the doordash delivery drivers because i heard stories of like wendy's being flooded with
twenty to thirty doordashers trying to pick up wendy's orders and having to wait like an hour
because wendy's was trying to fulfill like a hundred of these orders because everyone was
bombarding their local wendy's with doordash orders
so all in all i think they're probably never going to do that promotion again but yeah we got
thirty dollars of free wendy's in march which is an even better deal than those mcdonald's deals
that i was talking about in the previous episode so then tallying up the freebies and discounts

dollars from target amazon and wendy's for a grand total of three thousand and fifty dollars
plus 394 000 ultimate reward points on the cash side of things i do try and target like a thousand
dollars a month as my churning goal so barely scraped by there but understandable given i
sort of took january and february off but on the points front 394 000 chase points that's a pretty
good haul like that's almost half a million chase points in three months very very happy about that
and i value those at at least 1.5 cents per point when it comes to travels
so it's like six thousand dollars worth of free travel so yeah overall pretty good quarter and
