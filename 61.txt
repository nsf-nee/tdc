this really is the best retirement brokerage bonus i think like not just that i've ever seen
i think it's the highest that the industry as a whole has ever seen
hey everyone welcome to episode 61 of the daily churn today's episode is going to be a recap of
all of the things that i churned in march march was a pretty busy month overall it wasn't actually
even because of taxes i know a lot of us are pretty busy with taxes right now i've sort of
left my taxes until the last couple weeks in april so that's what april is going to be about
but march i'm going to be talking about the things that i've churned in march and i'm going to be
yeah it was just a lot of churning opportunities that came up there were a bunch of new credit card
offers that were pretty exciting plus some new credit card spend opportunities to kind of help
meet minimum spend plus i mean it was a really massive month for brokerage bonuses thanks
largely to one brokerage in particular that uh begins with a robin and ends with the hood
plus a totally new meal kit churn that we'll cover today that i haven't done before and i've done
a lot of meal kits
churns and my p2 and i also went on a bit of a burger buying eating spree there are a couple
really good burger discount offers in march and we'll also dive a little deeper into the pepper
app which i had covered a little bit in the previous monthly recap but we'll go a little
deeper because it's one of my new favorite apps for buying gift cards at a discount which is a
great option if you're trying to generate credit card spend so pretty much all of the things this
month but just a reminder as always that you can find the link in the description box below this
video and you can find everything that we're going to cover today in the show notes at the
daily churn podcast.com there's also a live churn tracker there that shows all of the things that
i'm churning in real time as i'm churning them plus a free newsletter a private discord community
pretty much all the things so definitely check it out if you haven't yet but for now let's get back
into the march recap i thought i'd start this episode a little differently this time and just
a quick hit of award travel news so the previous episode i did was about how to book award flights
using the various tools and processes that can make it a lot more efficient since posting that
episode i've gotten some really good comments about other tools that i hadn't covered before
that were new to me and i've been trying out over the last couple weeks that i'm really excited
about and i wanted to share quickly with you guys first one being award tool.com so if you remember
i was like hey it'd be cool if google flights would let you search for award flights which it
doesn't but award tool.com is basically like a google flights they basically copied the interface
of google flights so it looks almost exactly like google flights except it's searching for
award bookings so big shout out to isaac john and duck fan 101 for pointing out this tool exists
because it's pretty smooth and their pro version i think gives you 16 days of a search
window instead of eight days with points here and both of their pro versions points here and award
tool are pretty comparably priced so around 90 so i think they're both pretty good options i've been
using them interchangeably and have noticed no real differences between the two i think i still
kind of lean towards points here just because i'm used to the layout and the interface but if you're
totally brand new and you prefer google flights kind of a ui definitely award tool.com there's
also another one that chris over at all
the hacks pointed out which is points path.com and that one is an actual extension that you install
on your browser that then overlays award pricings directly onto google flights so it's sort of like
what we were talking about of just having google flights show award bookings unfortunately it
doesn't show all the airlines i think it doesn't have as much coverage as a war tool and points
here but points path.com also another great option the other interesting announcement
that happened on april 1st so april falls which i don't think it was an april falls joke because i
went to check it out and it is actually working is that points here now has hotels yeah which is
just like their hotels search tool which is also something i've been wishing existed before where
you can just plug in a city and it's going to show you the award rates for various hotels in that
city unfortunately again it doesn't show everything so like one thing i noticed is it doesn't show
so no intercontinental hotels show up on the award search i wish it was full coverage but as a
starting point it is a very useful way to kind of just figure out what are some of the award prices
in a new city where you may not be familiar with all of the various chains and programs that are
there in that city and so when it comes to like the planning phase of a new trip another tool which
i'll link to all of these tools by the way in the show notes so no need to try and memorize them but
another one that was mentioned by
matt over on discord which i found super useful was flightconnections.com so what that tool does
is you can plug in any destination let's say san francisco and it will just show you where are all
the places that planes fly to from san francisco like what are the carriers that fly out of san
francisco direct or indirect because i've definitely had that question sometimes it's
like okay i'm let's say based near jfk and i want to know what are all the direct flights
from jfk and maybe i want to go to cancun so jfk to cancun what are the airlines that fly directly
there without stopovers or maybe i'm more flexible and i just know i want to go to europe in the
summer so from jfk what are direct flights to europe like europe as a whole generally you know
i'll take any flight that's direct that takes me somewhere in europe because i don't really care
where in europe i go so for that kind of a search where you're just trying to explore your options
flightconnections.com is a really great starting point so you can figure out what are all the
airlines the carriers and the partners that will form the foundation of your later more advanced
searches on some of the other tools so a lot of really really useful great options for planning
your award flights and very grateful for everyone for recommending and sharing those ideas and just
finally on the award travel side of things the other news that impacts those of us with the
windom business earners card or those of us that have been thinking about getting the card because
they bumped up the signup bonus to a hundred thousand miles is that they've devalued their
partnership with veikasa so veikasa redemptions are one of the best redemption options for windom
points because with windom points you can redeem them for veikasa rentals and 15 000 points windom
points used to be able to redeem for a vacation rental that cost up to 350 dollars per bedroom
per night after all taxes and fees it used to be at 500 but they reduced that to 350 and now the
new devaluation is it's down to 250 the kind of silver lining though is that they have added an
option where you can redeem 30 000 points so twice as many points for a place that costs up to 500
dollars per bedroom per night after all taxes and fees the reason that's a silver lining in my
opinion is that it means that you can redeem for a vacation rental that costs up to 500 dollars per
bedroom per night it means that you can actually book places that cost up to 500 dollars per bedroom
per night whereas before when they reduced it down to 350 if the place cost 500 per bedroom per night
you simply just couldn't use your points for it it was out of the point redemption range now at
least you can use more points to get that more expensive rental and a lot of rentals are more
expensive you know you'll see a lot of veikasa rentals that are like you know eight nine hundred
dollars per night for a two bedroom so in the past you wouldn't have been able to buy a two bedroom
rental and book that at all but now you can spend 30 000 points per night in order to book it which
still ends up being a pretty good deal because with the windham business earners card you get a
10 discount on your points bookings so 30 000 points is really 27 000 points for a 500 per
bedroom booking so if you end up booking let's say a two bedroom rental that goes for a thousand
dollars a night total you'd be able to book that now for fifty four thousand windham points
so 60 000 with the 10 discount 54 000 which translates to roughly a 1.8 cent per point
redemption rate which is pretty good because it's really easy to get windham points once you have
that business earners card because it earns eight points per dollar so eight points per dollar not
two or three eight points per dollar on gas so if you can generate some gas spend you can accumulate
windham points very easily
all right so getting back to some march churns we're gonna start with brokerages because
brokerages really carried the team in march all thanks to uh daddy robin hood with their crazy
three percent retirement account transfer match bonus and that's the one that ends at the end of
april so i want to spend a little bit of time talking about it today because it is such an
insane bonus i mean if you've been
on the fence about the whole robin hood transfer thing like i i get it you know we all have uh
opinions about robin hood mostly negative but this really is the best retirement brokerage bonus
i think like not just that i've ever seen i think it's the highest that the industry as a whole
has ever seen if anyone has seen a better bonus than this let me know in the comments because
i'm curious what it was but currently there is nothing out there like it and because of that
a lot of us i think are down to set aside our feelings about robin hood a little bit just kind
of uh close our eyes and take their money because at the end of the day they are a publicly traded
company your money is sipc insured the insurance covers i believe five hundred thousand dollars per
account type so let's say you transfer in a roth ira that's covered by five hundred thousand dollars
and if you transfer in a traditional ira that's covered separately with another five hundred
thousand dollars of insurance
so at least from a risk perspective it is risk free now if you just don't want to move it over
for like moral reasons against robin hood that's fine i'm not going to try and convince you
otherwise but from a risk standpoint everything is insured and so we've basically been consolidating
everything every retirement account that we have into robin hood so the one that posted for us in
march was that my p2's traditional ira account moved that over to robin hood and that's what
happened to robin hood from fidelity that transfer took only a week and the bonus posted immediately
after that week so you get the whole bonus within a week and she got like thirteen thousand six hundred
and eighteen dollars from robin hood immediately and that's probably going to be the biggest bonus
of the year for us and it's only you know march april we also have some other retirement accounts
that are still in process like some roth iras randomly spread out across some other brokerages
so we're really glad that we're able to get that transfer and we're able to get the whole bonus
we're just trying to consolidate everything to robin hood because they're offering you three percent
on anything you move over so you know the size of the bonus is just entirely dependent on how much
retirement funds you have and someone just giving you three percent for free on your retirement
contributions is pretty crazy which is the other thing is that robin hood is also giving that three
percent not just on transfers but on any contributions you make this year into any of
your ira accounts and so for us we were kind of like you know we're kind of like you know we're
on the fence about whether or not we were gonna contribute to a roth ira this year but now with
the robin hood three percent we're like probably we should just do it right because you get what
is it sixty five hundred dollars i think for 2023 that you can contribute or thirteen thousand
dollars if you're a couple so if you contribute thirteen thousand dollars as a couple robin hood
is just giving you three hundred and ninety dollars for totally free and when i say free it's actually
completely free in this case because the way robin hood is posting these bonuses is also pretty crazy
they're posting these bonuses as interest in your retirement account so you don't have to pay
taxes on it now if it goes into a roth ira you never have to pay taxes on it at all because
roth ira funds aren't taxed when they come out in a traditional ira you would pay taxes when it
comes out but you don't owe any taxes on it today whereas if they posted it into let's say a taxable
brokerage or sent you a check you would owe taxes on it additionally because they are posting this
bonus as interest they're not going to be able to pay taxes on it when they come out so you don't
it doesn't count towards your contribution limit for the year this money they post does not count
against your contributions so you can still max out your contributions while robin hood is posting
the three percent bonus so let's say you transfer it in a hundred million dollars robin hood is
going to post three million dollars into your retirement account which is far above what the
contribution limits are for that account but they can do it because it's being posted as interest
essentially earnings on your retirement account so you can still max out your contributions
into your retirement account the whole thing is super crazy because it's not how other companies
are doing it so the other bonus you may have been thinking about is the weeble bonus for transferring
a retirement account where they'll give you 4.5 percent if you refer someone 4.5 percent on your
transfer and the issue with that one though is that it posts in five installments over five years
instead of immediately with robin hood but more importantly it posts into your
taxable brokerage account so you'll owe taxes on that bonus whereas with robin hood it's posting
as interest and you don't owe taxes so that sort of like messes with the math where initially 4.5
obviously is higher than three percent but once you factor those things in it may not actually
be a good proposition and actually mort over on the discord made a really good comparison
google sheet document which he kindly let us share here publicly and i'll link to that in
the show notes but basically you can plug in your numbers to see if the robin hood one or the weeble
one is going to be better for you depending on your tax situation because i think the tldr is
that if you're in a higher than a 26 tax bracket or you're in a state with higher income taxes
the robin hood three percent is going to be better than the weeble 4.5 then of course the other factor
that you may want to consider too is that because weeble is paying it out over five years how sure
you that weeble is going to be around for the whole five years to honor the promo i think the
latest news is that weeble as of february announced that they're merging with a an s-pack i think a
special purpose acquisition company i always get that acronym confused but you know these s-packs
that go public and merge with other companies to essentially just try and make a bunch of money
how viable is that long term whereas at least robin hood they're already public so they're
pretty legit in that sense
and the bonus is paid immediately so you don't have to depend on robin hood being around and that
kind of goes into the other point of like the reason why robin hood is even offering this three
percent which i mean i feel like most people agree at this point is that they're just trying to make
themselves look more attractive for a future acquisition and i think it's working like i
looked up the robin hood stock earlier today and they're up a hundred percent over the past year
fifty percent in the past three months alone so
whatever they're doing the investors are loving it and i think most people are maybe thinking
that an acquisition is coming down the line so they're really trying to juice up their numbers
by getting more people to join robin hood which isn't necessarily even a negative thing if they
got acquired because at the end of the day you know what do we actually care if they got acquired
if anything an acquisition depending on who acquires them and how they integrate robin hood
it might even negate some of the bonus terms like the
five-year lockup period that we're supposed to leave our funds with at robin hood so it could
end up even being a positive that they get acquired but that's i think sort of the backdrop of where
all of these crazy promos are coming from and also why weeble offered their promo because they're
also trying to go public trying to juice up their stats so all of that to say is that these promos
are kind of like a once-in-a-lifetime type of a thing you know like it's pretty unique to the
situation we're currently in and it's kind of like a once-in-a-lifetime type of a thing you know
in with these companies that they're offering these crazy promos and so i don't know when you're
ever going to see someone just coming around being like hey i'm going to increase your
retirement funds by three percent that's the offer they're doing and so that's why i've been pretty
excited about it my p2 a lot of people even on boggleheads one of the most conservative like
investing forums out there most people on there seem convinced of moving over to robin hood so
the other i guess final thing to consider with robin hood too if you do decide to do
the bonus is that it does end april 30th and you should probably start the transfer at least a
couple weeks before then just to be safe i don't remember if the cutoff was like you need to have
initiated the transfer by april 30th or if the transfer had to have completed by april 30th but
probably better to not leave it till the last minute you also need robin hood gold to get the
three percent match if you're not familiar with robin hood gold it's just their subscription i
think five dollars a month you have to do the transfer and then you have to do the transfer
for 12 months so a full year of robin hood gold in order to not negate your bonus like it's part
of the bonus terms that you need to keep robin hood gold active for a full year so that's going
to cost you sixty dollars i think you get the first month for free but one thing i found out
about robin hood gold that kind of like makes up for this fee is that robin hood gold gives you
one thousand dollars of free margin so i don't usually mess around with margins i'm not like a
by any means but one thousand dollars of free margin means robin hood is not charging you
interest on that margin they're basically giving you a thousand dollar loan for free while you have
robin hood gold active so how you can make that work in your favor with zero risk is to take that
thousand dollars that they lend you and buy escov the short-term treasury etf so escov earns whatever
the treasury rate is and that's roughly five dollars a month so that's a lot of money and
five percent so if you put your thousand dollars and you just buy escov with it that's going to earn
five percent or fifty dollars in a year which basically covers your gold membership completely
risk-free and so when you cancel your gold membership after a year just remember to undo
your margin position in escov but otherwise just a very very simple process i just did that for my p2
and i'm about to do it for myself but yeah tallying up brokerages it really was just robin hood for us
all we needed because it ended up being thirteen thousand six hundred and eighteen dollars that
posted tax-free into our retirement account moving right on to credit cards the first one we're going
to talk about real quick is the robin hood gold card i swear this podcast is not being sponsored
by robin hood but they've really just been marketing the crap out of their products and
putting some really interesting attractive promos out there so the gold card is going to offer three
percent cash back and that's going to be a lot of money and that's going to be a lot of money and
cash back on anything so three percent cash back across the board it's a pretty crazy card and so
i've been debating whether or not to open it it's waitlist only right now so i added myself to the
waitlist and it will take up a 524 slot which is the only reason i am not like of course i'm going
to open it but three percent is about as good as it gets when you consider the fact that it's three
percent no categories everything and they're saying it's going to be unlimited like no cap
on the amount you can get back
with three percent so of course this is robin hood and it's a waitlist so it very much could
just be a may not even ever launch kind of a thing but if it does launch and you end up getting it
and you're able to find a way to generate spend that costs less than three percent it's basically
like printing money so yeah i don't know how to feel about it i mean we'll talk about it more
probably when it actually launches the other gimmicky thing they're doing with the car to i
guess
they're going to ship out a solid gold version of the card to a few people i think it's going to be
like worth eleven hundred dollars of gold because it's like 14 karat gold that they're going to make
the card out of if you refer 10 people to join the waitlist and join robin hood gold as well
unclear like how many they're really gonna make or if the whole thing launches at all but if you
want to get me a gold card i'll uh i'll put my referral link on the website and if it ends up
happening i promise to post a photo and probably a video as well of me melting the card down into
the actual gold so yeah that's uh hopefully some added incentive but robin hood aside let's get
back to some actual credit card companies insurance the big one being amex because amex has been going
crazy with their offers lately like really really good offers amex business platinum is now at an
all-time high of
150 000 amex points for 15 000 of spend like i remember being really excited a month or two back
even a couple weeks back about pulling up a 190 000 business platinum offer via like a vpn through
dallas and chrome or safari incognito and having my friends do the same and like telling them you
should apply for 190 because that's really good and then of course like a week or two later we
now have pretty reliable methods of pulling up the 250 000
point offer and on top of that amex has been running the referral promo where if you refer
someone you get 10x on dining so 10 points extra on dining for the person who's doing the referring
so you know if you refer from a business gold that already earns 4x on your top categories
so let's say your top category was dining then you get another 10x on top of that you're earning 14x
on dining 14 points per dollar on dining which is absolutely crazy
so we'll cover both of those in more depth in a little bit but first i wanted to address a couple
comments and questions that came up in the last recap when i was talking about all the credit
cards i'm opening which is basically like how do you get all of your spend like how are you meeting
spend for these bonuses and are you like paying for spend does your spend cost you any money and
if it does you should probably factor that in to the monthly recap numbers so totally valid
and so i wanted to run through a little bit about how i approach meeting minimum spend you know i
generally prefer not to use options that cost money so a big option that is pretty popular for
folks is paying taxes so you can pay your taxes with a credit card it's just that they'll charge
you i think around two percent a little over two percent as a fee but you can use your amex card
your chase card any card and that's a totally legitimate way of generating credit card
but it does cost money and so it's not my first go-to method i would prefer you know over that
like doing buying groups which i did an episode on i think episode 51 or kroger fuel points which i
did another episode episode 47 on but my favorite option is just straight up bank funding like
funding a bank account with your credit card for example right now you can open a business bank
account with us bank and you can open a business bank account with us bank and you can open a
business bank account with us bank and fund that with three thousand dollars and that even takes
amex so you could put three thousand dollars on your amex to fund a business bank account at us
bank and you can even open multiple business bank accounts at us bank and fund that three thousand
dollars multiple times so us bank their personal accounts used to also accept a three thousand
dollars of credit card funding but that's since been reduced to i think only five hundred dollars
and that's the thing with bank funding is that there's always like
this push-pull effect where they'll offer it a lot of people do it and they decide it's not worth
the cost to the bank and so they end up nerfing it the really big one that i'll share here that
was kept private and now i think it's pretty public so i think it's pretty safe to share plus
the fact that it died but before it died it was a really amazing option which was keypoint so key
point is a credit union they for a while was offering like twenty five hundred dollars of
credit card funding and you can open like a
checking account or a saving account and fund that with twenty five hundred dollars or you can
open a cd a certificate for twenty five hundred dollars well sometime in i think it was february
they randomly increased that from twenty five hundred dollars to fifteen thousand dollars when
you open a new account with them and matt over on our private discord i think was actually the
first person to discover this because he was randomly just happened to be opening the keypoint
account one night and he sent us a screenshot of the keypoint account and we were like oh my god
it's a screenshot being like hey guys it says fifteen thousand dollars now is that like are we
all seeing the same thing and of course we all went to check and yep it had increased like overnight
someone decided a keypoint let's allow fifteen thousand dollars of credit card funding and you
can kind of imagine what happened next is that we all did it it spread to other groups it's on doc
now it's on reddit and everyone was slamming keypoint with fifteen thousand dollars of credit
card funding and then within like a month or so so it actually lasted quite a while like a month
a good month where you were able to just open as many certificates with keypoint as you wanted to
for fifteen thousand dollars of credit card funding and uh it ended up dying they reduced
it back down i think now to only five hundred dollars so completely killed it but that's just
sort of how it goes with churning you know new opportunities will come up they'll die
other opportunities will come around and it was good to see that and i think that's kind of the
while it lasted but usually when things get shared very publicly like on reddit r churning
doctor of credit or blog or even a podcast they tend to die really quickly which is why we have
a private discord to chat about some of the more sensitive deals that are out there but yeah bank
funding is definitely my my favorite go-to for meeting credit card spend there's a new app
currently pepper i covered it a little bit in the last recap but that's currently
my new favorite uh it's a way of buying gift cards at a very heavy discount and i'll cover
that more in depth once we get to the discounts and freebies part of this recap but hopefully
that helped a little bit to answer some questions and give you some ideas for how to get sign up
bonuses even if your expenses are fairly low but getting back into some of these credit card churns
so the two hundred and fifty thousand point amex business platinum one yeah i just
opened that in march really amazing offer and i want to walk through how to generate that offer
how to pull it up because it doesn't just show up organically for everyone so the way i ended up
getting it to pull up and this was based on a lot of data points on the discord from folks sharing
how they were able to successfully get it to show up because the amex algorithm is very complex and
very much a black box is that with this offer all you need to do is google amex business platinum
and you'll get the google search engine and you'll get the google search engine and you'll get the
google search results page with the sponsored and a non-sponsored link i don't think it really
matters which one you click i think i use the non-sponsored link and you'll click that and
it'll show you an offer of like 120 000 points or 190 000 points and you just wait leave that page
don't touch it put it in a different like window if you're using a mac and just wait i think around
20 minutes and it'll time out and after it times out you have an option to refresh like amex will
show you like a button to like refresh your offer
you want to click that and sometimes when you click that the next offer they show you is the
250 000 point offer now it doesn't always show that to you and it can take a lot of trial and
error to give you some context it took me about two full weeks of refreshing that page to get
that offer to show up i think a lot of people got it a lot quicker than that but i was trying a bunch
of different things like using different browsers because amex cares sometimes about what browser
you're on using a vpn or something like that and i was trying a bunch of different things like using
a vpn because amex cares sometimes about your location it turns out with this one it's actually
a lot simpler you don't want to use a vpn all the data points i've seen have been with people not
on a vpn that were able to pull up this offer additionally this time it doesn't seem to matter
really what browser you're using i think incognito is the go-to i got it on chrome incognito i've
seen data points of people using opera firefox safari so less like browser
dependent this time so just google it on incognito without a vpn activated so actually a pretty
basic process right and just leave that open maybe you're at work you have that open as a tab
somewhere else and then you know every 20 30 minutes just go back in and hit the refresh button
and eventually you should see that 250 000 point offer which is an amazing offer and you should
definitely apply if you're eligible so i'll be working on that spend for a little while it's
fifteen thousand dollars with amex which is a little harder
sometimes to to get spend on than chase or visa the other card i opened in march was the loaves
amex business card you're probably like why did you open that card that card i opened because
of that 10x dining referral so if you recall the way that 10x dining referral works is that the
person referring you gets 10x not the person joining so what i did was my p2 my wife she had
that 10x offer i think
everyone right now has that 10x offer as a referral offer so she referred me so that she could get the
10x and it's 10x on dining on up to 25 000 of spend over the course of three months and she referred
me from her amex business gold card so it matters what card you're referring from because that is
the card that's going to earn 10x so you don't have to refer from an amex business gold it's just
that the amex business gold is going to be the 10x that you're referring from so you don't have to
refer from an amex business gold it's just
the 10x that you're referring from so you don't have to refer from an amex business gold it's just
gives you four points per dollar on your top two categories each month so if dining is one of those
top two categories you're going to get 4x points on top of the 10x from the referral for 14 points
per dollar if you referred from let's say your amex platinum that's totally fine too but you're
just only going to get the 10x points from the referral and then the 1x points that you regularly
earn with the platinum card for 11 points per dollar total so ideally you're referring from
the business card so that's what i did so if you're referring from an amex business gold it's
gold but the reason i opened the lowes business card when my wife referred me instead of some
other card is because the referral offers as the person being referred are kind of crappy like i
think their business gold offer when you use a referral link is only 70 000 points whereas you
can pull up the 150 000 point business gold using the same method i described above where like
you know you search for amex business platinum
in google and these days you don't even need a vpn to pull up the 190k amex business platinum
offer and then from that page you can navigate to the business gold and if you're seeing 190 000
points for the business platinum you'll most likely see the 150 000 point offer for the
business gold which is double that 70 000 point offer that you're getting via referral so it just
doesn't make sense to open one of these cards via referral when the only thing you need to do to
trigger that 10x for your p2 is to open any card with amex so it's better just to open a burner
card that you don't really care about like the lowes business card the kind of funny thing when
i try to open that lowes business card too though it was that i'm in pop-up jail for even the lowes
business card which in this case it doesn't really matter if you're in pop-up jail or not for one of
these cards you're opening because you don't need the signup bonus i think the signup bonus for the
business card is like
five
back at lowes for six months like who cares about that right so you just accept the pop-up saying i
won't get a bonus and you open the card anyway and then your p2 should get an email saying hey
you've triggered the 10x dining referral offer and you'll be able to earn 10x points extra for
the next three months and that is the ultimate goal here so we'll be working on that spend as
well in the next few months but what did post in march for p2 was the bonus for the business gold
card that she opened
i think a couple two three months ago for the 150 000 point offer for ten thousand dollars of spend
she got lucky because when she applied for that she didn't get any pop-up i guess it's been long
enough since she'd opened a business card that amex was like yep we want to approve you for one
so that was super easy and she ended up getting the 150 000 points for the bonus plus 20 000
points from spend for a total of 170 000 amex points for my p2 in march then i got the bonus for the
canadian shop I also got a bonus as well so my height business card that i'd opened posted that
was 75 000 high at points for fifteen thousand dollars of spend i had quite a few heights
days coming up later in this year so i'm kind of considering making a run for globaliste so
that's kind of why i opened that card plus you know the changes in 2025 are that there are not
going to be any more guest of honor phone bookings 2024 is the last year to do guests of honor phone
phone bookings are great because you can do as many of them as you want if you're a globalist
starting in 2025 the only way to book a guest of honor for you know your family or your friends
is to gift them a guest of honor certificate and you only earn three of those certificates
when you hit globalist and then you earn another certificate i think every 10 nights but starting
out you only get those three whereas right now our globalist friend kong over at kongflu.com
i mean he's booking like a lot definitely double digits i want to say have we hit triple digits in
guest of honor bookings yet i don't think we're quite that far yet but he's been very busy for us
in 2024 so appreciate you kong but sadly that gravy train is going to dry up starting in 2025
so now i kind of want globalist for myself so i don't have to rely on anyone for their limited
guest of honor bookings so yeah it is what it is but in terms of bonuses i got the 75
thousand dollar bookings and i got the 75 thousand dollar bookings and i got the 75 thousand dollar
points from the business card for meeting the signup bonus plus 15 000 from spend for a total
of 90 000 hyatt points in march then i also had a couple chase ink referrals i referred my p2 to an
ink card and i want to say like a listener from the show maybe use one of my referrals if that
was you definitely appreciate you because i ended up getting two of those for 80 000 points total
chase points then there was also a couple uh capital one
referrals too so big shout out to teething for using my capital one business venture x referral
plus someone else used one as well so i'm guessing another listener so i got two of those
for 25 000 points times two 50 000 capital one points and yeah that was it for credit cards like
tallying that all up it was 170 000 amex points from the gold card 90 000 higher points plus
80 000 chase points plus 50 000 capital one points and i got two of those for 25 000 points
for a total of 390 000 credit card points in march next up we have banks so a bit of a slow
month for me for banks in march i kind of prioritized credit card bonuses and brokerage
bonuses more than banks just because they were so much more lucrative and neglected banks a little
bit i don't love neglecting banks but you can't churn everything all the time unless you want to
you know spend 40 80 hours a week churning
but yeah i got a couple bonuses though from upgrade the upgrade checking account so that's
the one where you get 200 for depositing 1 000 so super easy bonus and i think it's pretty popular
with folks because it is so easy and i got six referrals from that between myself and p2 each
referral is worth 50 six of those 300 so thank you for everyone who used the upgrade referrals
because i'm officially maxed out now on upgrade referrals they cap it at 10
referrals per offer that they do so what i've been actually doing for the last few weeks is i've
been rotating in upgrade checking account referrals from the discord i was kind of inspired by frequent
miler so what frequent miler does is they post member referrals on their referral page which
they source from i think facebook in our case i'm just sourcing these from the referrals channel
on discord it's kind of going down the list and every couple days i'll switch it out for someone
else's referral and i'll be able to get them back to me so i'm going to be able to get them back to
i don't know how many have been used or not used hopefully a few of you got a nice surprise with
an extra upgrade referral but yeah got 300 from bank referrals in march moving right on to meal
kits so really really interesting month for meal kits because um there's a new meal kit out there
i mean i guess they're not new but new to me that i haven't churned before which is surprising
and that's marley spoon so they're the meal kit that's partnered with martha
stewart so you can kind of get a sense for what kind of meals they are pretty bougie really good
recipes though and taste wise i mean out of all the meal kits i've done and i've done a lot like
i've cooked at this point hundreds of meal kits if not close to a thousand and tried tens of
different meal kit companies this one hands down wins in terms of quality ingredients and just
general taste i mean really really impressed
with marley spoon and it's like i've been getting marley spoon flyers for over a year i think and i
just kind of ignored them like the signup offer wasn't that interesting i don't think the deal
was that good but i think in march it was the end of february one of our discord members nsf
he has gotten us all into marley spoon it's a massive hat tip to him because he figured out
some creative workarounds to really maximize that marley spoon signup offer where you can end up
getting a meal kit and then you can get a meal kit and then you can get a meal kit and then you can
essentially a $200 box for only $11 shipping one of the caveats though is that you do need a
referral to get that first free box and marley spoon referrals are surprisingly hard to come by
because marley spoon now that i have an account i can see they only let you generate one referral
at a time and most likely you're just like referring your p2 or someone you know versus
posting them publicly on the internet but luckily i got one from nsf
i also referred my p2 so she also got her box recently it's just been really good and everyone
on the discord has also been very excited about marley spoon i think we've just become like a
marley spoon circle jerk channel at this point but if you need referrals check out the meal kits
channel on the discord and someone can definitely hook you up i mean it's a really great box i'm
going to count these more than i usually count them in terms of a discount usually i'm just like
one of these boxes when i get it for free from hello fresh
it's worth maybe fifty dollars even though i'm getting like two hundred dollars worth of food
from hello fresh in this case that box is definitely worth a hundred dollars it would
have cost two hundred dollars if you paid for it out of pocket but to me the quality of the food
i would have paid a hundred dollars for that box instead i got it for free so got two of those in
march i'm going to count that as two one hundred dollar savings for a total of two hundred dollars
in meal kit savings in march finally we have discounts and freebies
pretty busy march for discounts and freebies largely because of the pepper app so it's
definitely worth trying it's the one i talked about in the previous recap where you can buy
the gift card through an app and they give you five percent cash back on the gift card you're
buying so for example let's say you buy a hundred dollar amazon gift card pepper would give you five
dollars back which is five percent and you can use your credit card to buy that gift card in the first
place including amex cards
so you're earning points from your credit card on top of the five percent cash back
and ideally you're also meeting a minimum spend which makes it even more lucrative
but it gets better because they ran a promo that gave you double cash back for 30 days if you joined
using a referral so instead of only getting five dollars back when you spend a hundred dollars at
amazon you get ten dollars back or if you spend a thousand dollars at let's say walmart that only
costs you nine hundred dollars because you get a hundred dollars back when you spend a hundred dollars
of cash back if you spend ten thousand dollars at home depot that only costs you nine thousand
dollars because you get a thousand dollars of cash back so you kind of get the idea of how this can
potentially scale up very quickly and these gift cards that you buy you can either use them for
yourself or resell the gift cards either directly or through a buying group and you should be able
to at least make up ninety percent of the face value which is also how much you paid so it ends
up being a break-even thing except you're also earning credit card points and sign up bonuses on top of that
so in our case we just bought a few thousand of like amazon and home depot and pet smart basically
stores that we frequent quite a lot and just stocked up you know if you just calculate how
much money you think you're gonna spend at let's say amazon or walmart in the next three to six
months it's probably quite a lot of money right and so just buy the gift card equivalent of that
on pepper while the double cash back is going to save you a lot of money if you're going to spend
a lot of cash back is active now in the last recap i wasn't that excited about pepper in the sense
that the double cash back had died the 30 days was no longer being offered where they were giving you
10 cash back so i wasn't really trying to like convince people to sign up for it but it is back
again so they've reinstated that promo except now instead of 30 days it's only 15 days where you get
double 10 cash back but two weeks i mean that's still pretty great if you have like a sign-up bonus
that you need to meet just make sure you spend all the money you need on these gift cards in that
two-week time frame and if you're newer to pepper or this is the first time you've heard of it there
are a couple things to keep in mind one being that pepper has a twenty five hundred dollar per day
limit on how many gift cards you can buy now you can contact them to increase that if you're going
really hard so that is definitely viable but that said some retailers are limited to just five hundred
dollars a day so if you're going really hard you can contact them to increase that if you're going
two thousand dollars a day two thousand dollars a week and there's no way to increase that for
example best buy unfortunately there isn't like a list of these vendors it's sort of just trial and
error you just try buying it and if you're hitting limits then you know it's one of these vendors
that are limited luckily at least i can confirm with home depot and amazon and pet smart they are
not limited at five hundred dollars per day another thing to note is that the double cash back the 10
cash back for 15 days
that is only available via referral so you don't want to just sign up without a referral you need
to enter a referral code during sign up and the person referring gets twenty dollars and then you
get the ten percent the double cash back so the other part is that you need to spend a hundred
dollars to activate the offer so just go in and actually buy something like buy a gift card for a
hundred dollars otherwise the offer won't activate then in terms of the bonuses posting you won't
see that additional five percent post into your account until after that fifteen day period is
over so on the sixteenth day you're gonna get pepper coins posted into your account so the way
pepper does cash back is via coins that you redeem it sounds more complicated than it is but basically
you won't get those coins until that offer period is over so don't expect to see the extra five
percent as you're buying the gift cards additionally for the person referring you won't see that five percent as you're buying the gift cards
that $20 until that 15-day period ends as well. And then when that $20 referral bonus posts,
it posts not as coins, but as anywhere cash. I'm not sure why they went with that method instead.
It's functionally the same thing. Coins or anywhere cash, you just redeem for gift cards
because you can't cash any of this stuff out of Pepper directly. The way you cash it out is to buy
gift cards. And one thing I read that's a little concerning is that the anywhere cash you get from
referrals, apparently that expires in two weeks after receiving it. Now, I haven't seen anywhere
on Pepper mentioning that, but I think I saw a comment somewhere either on DOC or the Discord
where someone was like, yeah, it expires after two weeks and you have to email Pepper to get
that reinstated. So just to be safe, ideally, as soon as you get the coins or the anywhere cash,
just use it. Don't store it. Just turn it into gift cards. In our case, we just bought a bunch
of Amazon gift cards and cashed it.
out via Amazon because to us, Amazon is as good as cash. But yeah, that's a quick and dirty on
how to use Pepper and why it's good for minimum spend. If you need a referral to Pepper, I have
all of my referrals on the dailychurnpodcast.com slash referrals. In March, I ended up getting
one referral for referring my P2 and then another eight from the listeners. So thank you very much
because that was nine referrals total for a hundred and eighty dollars in anywhere cash,
which we converted straight into Amazon. We also went on a bit of a burger eating spree in March
because there were a couple really good burger deals. So the one that sadly has ended is the
Shake Shack Smoke Shack burger that was free with any ten dollar purchase at Shake Shack. So
essentially a buy one, get one free on Shake Shack burgers. And we love their burgers. I mean,
they're really, really good quality meat and ingredients. I'd say one of probably the best
quality burgers you can get. That's in the description below. So if you're interested,
you can go to the link in the description below. So if you're interested, you can go to the link
in the description below. But they're kind of pricey when there's no deal. I mean, you end up
paying, I think we pay like twenty five dollars for two burgers and a drink and fries. So without
the promo, definitely we don't really go there. But with the promo, we ended up doing it twice,
almost did it three times, but kind of felt my veins getting a little bit thicker. So we held
off there because you could use that code as many times as you want during that period of like two
weeks, which was kind of amazing. You know, there was no cap, but also amazing because
every time in line while we're waiting, then there's always a line. There's always like 10,
15, 20 people in front of us. And I kind of just watched them use the kiosk. No one was entering
the code for the free burgers. Everyone was just buying multiple burgers and no one was entering
it just for like literally it's free money for a free burger and no one was doing it.
And it kind of just reminded me about this whole churning thing where most people don't do it or
don't know about it or don't think to do it. Like we really are in the wampum.
Of people when it comes to getting things for free and earning points and flying for free and
booking a war, like the whole game is centered around just where the 1% of the 1% of folks who
actually go out and seek this to maximize these things. And yeah, I don't know. It just like
reminded me just to, I guess, be grateful that I discovered this and that we're able to do all
these things and save all this money because the majority of the population are not,
doing it. And you sometimes forget that that's the case when you're in this kind of churning
echo chamber, listening to a churning podcast on the churning discord. So yeah, anyways,
we ended up doing that a couple of times, two free burgers. They're worth like $8 each.
So saved 16 bucks at Shake Shack. The other burger deal that we've been doing, which is still alive
is the Wendy's deal. So Wendy's is letting you on the app, redeem an offer each week for a
1% off. So that's a great deal. And I think that's a great deal. I think that's a great deal.
$1 Dave's single burger or $2 Dave's double burger. And you can do that once a week until
April 10th. So I think you've got another week of it when this episode comes out.
So usually it's $7 for a Dave's double versus paying $2 with this deal. So if you like Wendy's,
which we do, it's a really great deal. But similar to Shake Shack, it's crazy to think
people are paying like $7 or $8 off to tax for this burger. Like I don't think the Wendy's Dave's
double is worth $8. I'd rather get $8. I don't think it's worth $8. I don't think it's worth $8.
at that price. But for $2, it's pretty good. I mean, generally like fast food prices are kind
of surprising to me these days because the other fast food place we like is just McDonald's. I know
we basic, but McDonald's has the great like app deals, which I did an episode on, I think episode
40 on how to get those secret McDonald's menu deals. So I'm still used to paying just a dollar
or two for my fast food. But I forget the full price now is like what restaurant food used to
cost like a decade.
So pretty crazy. We ended up doing it twice because you can do this offer every week via
the app. And it's key that you use the app versus doing it in person because the times I've tried
to use Wendy's offers in person, the scan thing never works. And it always ends up with them
calling a manager over who has to apply the whole thing manually. Like it's a whole thing, you know.
So instead, we just order them from mobile pickup. And yeah, in March, I did two burgers for me,
two for P2, so four burgers total, saved $5 on each of those burgers for $20 in savings.
Finally, we have a couple other easy discounts that I did in March. So Amazon was doing their
big spring sale event at the end of March. And anytime Amazon does an event like that,
like let's say Prime Day or Prime Day 2 or a big spring sale, they tend to refresh their Amazon
Amex offer. That's the offer where you can redeem one Amex point.
And get like 30% off at Amazon up to $100, so up to $30 back basically. Most people get retargeted
again whenever one of these sales happen. But depending on how they target you, it sounds like
some folks are stuck at only getting 10% back when they use one Amex point. Some are really lucky and
see 40 or 50%. In our case, my P2, she always consistently gets that 30% offer. So worth
checking just to see if you've been retargeted. I'll link to that link in the show notes.
Where you can activate the offer and see if you've been targeted. But for us,
we just got the $30 back from Amazon using one Amex point.
Then I also got a Top Cashback payout. So Top Cashback is just one of those
shopping portals, kind of like Rakuten or Rebates.me. We use that occasionally,
you know, you go to cashbackmonitor.com and just see which place has the best cashback.
And occasionally it's Top Cashback. That's pretty much the only reason time when we use it.
I think this
payout was mostly comprised of getting like VPNs for free. That's sort of Top Cashback's specialty.
So if you go on their website, they'll tell you, you know, what offers are out there,
what's giving the most cashback. And usually you'll see a VPN service on there
that gets a hundred percent or more cashback. So they're basically paying you to sign up
for VPN. And it's useful to have a VPN for things like Amex or getting ANA,
flight bookings during Tokyo time. A lot of different reasons why you might want a VPN
and not paying for it. Getting it for free through Top Cashback is the way to go.
So I ended up getting, I think it was like $81 of payout from Top Cashback if you redeem it
for a Visa gift card, because they give you a 5% bonus if you redeem it for Visa. And then
I usually just reload that Visa prepaid right into Amazon. So yup, $81 through that. And lastly, in March, I got a $195 visa.
So yep, $81 through that. And lastly, in March, I got a $195 visa.
And lastly, in March, I got a $195 visa.
And lastly, in March, I got a $195 visa.
And lastly in March, I got a $195 visa.
And lastly, in March, I got a $195 visa.
lastly, in March, I got my P2, a new MacBook Air M3. If you follow Apple News, that's the one that
just came out in March. And I've been waiting to buy that one for a few months now because what I
did was I stocked up on Apple gift cards during Cyber Monday via Citi because Citi sells Apple
gift cards on their shopping portal. And every Cyber Monday, they discount the Apple gift cards
by 20%. So instead of it costing 10,000 points for a $100 Apple gift card, it only costs 8,000
points during Cyber Monday. And the way they usually do it is around Black Friday, it discounts
to 10%, then it increases to 15%. And then by Cyber Monday, it's at the high of 20%. So make
sure you're patient and you wait till Cyber Monday. And that's what I did last November,
where I cashed out 96,000 Citi points for $1,200 of Apple gift cards.
Usually that would have cost 120,000 Citi points, but because they were discounting it,
it only cost 96K. And I had the rewards plus Citi card, which gives you 10% back on your
Citi points redemptions up to 100K per year. So I got 10% back. So instead of it costing 96K,
it really only costs about 86K for that $1,200 worth of Apple gift cards. So really great value
there. And I've just been sitting on those gift cards, waiting for the M3 MacBook Air to
release, which by the way, if you are sitting on a bunch of Apple gift cards, the Apple store
only lets you use eight gift cards at a time. And I had 12 of them. And I found out that the
workaround is you can load gift cards into your Apple balance and your Apple balance has a max
of $2,000. So I was just able to load all 12 into my Apple balance. And then you can apply
your balance during checkout versus trying to apply these gift cards individually during
checkout. So I was able to load all 12 into my Apple balance and then you can apply your balance
So that's how you get around that eight gift card limit on the online store. And yeah,
that's how I got my P2, a new MacBook. She was using like a 2015 11-inch MacBook. They don't
even make those anymore. So she definitely loved the upgrade. The M3 chips are really insane. Like
if you're, you know, even remotely interested in Apple, the M chips are just, okay, I'm not going
to fanboy over Apple too much, but yeah, I got her a new MacBook, nothing really even to count
discounts wise. Cause I just redeemed points. I guess it was just a quick little Apple brag that
we got P2, a new, new MacBook air basically for free. Thanks to city points, but tallying up
discounts and freebies in March, it was the $180 of pepper referrals, $16 of Shake Shack discounts,
$20 from Wendy's $30 on Amazon and $81 from the top cash back payout for a total of $327 in discounts
and freebies in March. All right. So tallying everything up, it was $13,618 from Robin hood
for brokerages for credit cards. There was 390,000 points from Amex Hyatt chase and capital one.
Then for banks, just $300 from upgrade with milk kits, $200 from Marley discounts and freebies.
We had that $327 for a total of $14,000.
$445 plus 390,000 points. What a massive month. I mean, obviously Robin hood really
contributed towards a lot of that. I guess if we subtract Robin hood, it would have been $827
in cash and the 390,000 points versus 14,000. I mean, still pretty decent even without Robin hood,
but Robin hood probably going to be the biggest churn of the year with that kind of a bonus.
And yeah, if you haven't done,
Robin hood, I mean, even if you don't have tons of money to transfer over, moving in like $10,000,
you're still getting 3%, like $300, which is still an amazing deal. So yeah, I guess I could probably
just relax and take the rest of the year off when it comes to churning, but April is shaping up to
be pretty busy too, especially with taxes coming up. So that's going to be a fun recap, but as
