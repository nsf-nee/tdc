you had seven different phone lines across like google voice like four different cell phones a
landline calling a and a at the same time around 9 a.m so that if one of them picks up early you
can hang up and wait for the next one it's a whole thing and it's i mean it's pretty intense
for an award booking and you kind of have to ask yourself like is this worth the stress of having
to do that hey everyone welcome to episode 58 of the daily churn today's episode is going to be a
pretty special one it's a an update to an episode i did in the past on how to book a and a first and
business class tickets but this is going to be an update for 2024 because
a lot of people have been asking me about how to book a and a first and business class tickets
have happened since i think it's been a couple years since i recorded that episode and that
episode is still one of the most popular episodes of the show i think it's like more than double or
triple the number of plays of the second most popular episode so it's definitely one of the
ones that i still get a lot of emails and questions on and over the last couple years yeah just a lot
of things have changed with how to go about booking these and i'm now just you know in the last few
weeks i've been able to book a and a first and business class tickets and i've been able to book
really just trying to catch up on all these changes and figure out some new ways to book you
know fancy flights essentially to japan because my friends and i we try and take a japan trip at
least once every couple years sometimes it's annually but we love going for the snowboarding
so we try and time it for winter love eating ramen love hanging out in tokyo but also in
niseko for the amazing powdery snow and so 2025 is when we plan on going and so now is sort of
the time to go and book a and a first and business class tickets and i've been able to book a and a
stuff booked and it's always tough for us because we're flying with a group of sometimes like 10 12
people and everyone of course wants to fly first and business and the changes with a and a yeah
they've been uh not great however there are of course workarounds and new alternatives and so
what i want to do in this episode is kind of just cover if you haven't been keeping up on
all the flyer talk threads which you know is a lot to keep up on what's been happening
with a and a what are some of these changes and also present a kind of a less stressful less
competitive alternative to a and a which is jal japan airlines which you may have seen in the news
recently because they're the flight that caught on fire when they landed on another plane but
i think that's a pretty rare thing to happen so i wouldn't necessarily worry about flying japan
airlines it is a very nice airline it's like you know on par with a and a and also kind of go into
like how you go about flying japan airlines and i think that's a pretty rare thing to happen so i
book these japan airlines flights so we'll cover some of these pros and cons and quirks of booking
through cafe pacific and then at the end i'll just run through what we ended up booking so if you
wanted to kind of mirror a similar itinerary you kind of know what to expect going in you know like
who do you have to call what points do you have to transfer what do you have to keep in mind of like
when are these seats getting
released at what time all that good stuff we're going to cover so it's going to be a fun episode
but before we get into it just a reminder that everything we talk about today can be found
in the show notes at the daily churn podcast.com there's also a free newsletter if you want to get
these show notes sent to you via email whenever one of these episodes comes out there's also a
private discord all kinds of good stuff on the website so definitely check it out if you haven't
yet but for now let's get back into how to book a and a and japan airlines
first in business class in 2024
so i thought i'd start with an a and a update first because i think a and a is the one that
most of us are familiar with either just because we've flown it ourselves or have tried booking it
or are currently trying to book it and so some of the changes that have happened since the a and a
episode came out a couple years ago are that it's a lot harder to book it now it's become
extremely complicated and it's a lot harder to book it now it's become extremely complicated and
competitive but not only more competitive but also a lot more inconsistent with how many award
seats they release so the competitive aspect you know i kind of get because i think it's pretty
common knowledge now that a and a releases flights at 9 a.m tokyo time back when i recorded that
episode that was sort of a an unknown thing but i think just over time now that's pretty common
knowledge and that's adding to some of the competitiveness of people trying to book it
right at 9 a.m but that alone is a lot harder to book and i think that's a lot harder to book
wouldn't be such a huge issue if it wasn't for the inconsistency problem because back when i
recorded the episode they were releasing two business and two first class seats every single
day since then it's become most days only one first and one business being released with sporadic
days depending on the day of the week and the route you're flying you'll sometimes see two
business or two first or two first and two first and two first and two first and two first and two
business and two first it's been completely unpredictable as to when two seats are released
at a time it's mostly one seat at a time but it does happen contrary to some opinions online where
they're like they've just stopped releasing two first no it actually does happen where they do
release two first and i can confirm that happens because one of our friends he's a pretty big points
and miles and flights enthusiast kong hat tip to kong by the way
because a lot of this episode is from research that kong did like he really kind of carried the
team this year because i was just like man i feel burnt out from like the a and a booking two years
ago so i didn't feel like taking the lead on it this year but kong really stepped up and literally
tracked a and a award releases at 9 a.m tokyo time for like 30 days straight to try and figure
out if there was a pattern so massive shout out and thank you to kong fyi kong has a new
blog where he talks about some of these flight bookings and award bookings that's over at
kongflu.com so kind of like kung fu but kong flu but not like flu like covid flu flu like flying
flu and his name is kong so kong flu yeah it's a it's a pretty good name man i'm glad you went with
that definitely check it out i'll put a link to that in the show notes but if it wasn't for the
research that kong did i would probably still just be neck deep in flyer talk threads but tldr is the
he discovered that they do release two business and two first sometimes and sometimes the whole
return trip with the dummy return is bookable a couple days later so they're not getting snapped
up instantly however it is pretty rare some weekdays like tuesdays wednesdays occasionally
thursdays you'll see it weekends not so much depending on the route like chicago to tokyo
is a lot more available for two first than going from jfk to tokyo where they don't seem to release
that as often
and of course the jfk route is a lot more competitive so for example we were looking
at mid january 2025 around 355 days out which is when they release these award tickets and jfk to
tokyo with a dummy return back from tokyo to jfk the very next day that was still 100 bookable with
two first class tickets as of like a few weeks ago it got snapped up eventually like a couple
days later but it was there for like a decent amount of time like you didn't even have to
call in right at 9 a.m to get it you could just look online a few hours later and it was still
there however it wasn't the dates that we wanted we wanted to go in late january early february and
so we didn't actually end up booking that one but it did give some glimmers of hope that this is
still a possibility in 2024 so kong went ahead and transferred over 300 000 miles from amex to
ana and of course you can kind of see where this is going you know the second you say it's not
and you don't bring your umbrella it's going to rain on you and so the second he moved over his
300 000 points no more jfk tokyo flights with two first class tickets came up in the following like
few weeks that he was looking at it like just zero so just very sporadic and random as to when
they release like a couple jfk tokyo flights did show up but again you have to wait for the next
day for the return the dummy return to be bookable and by the time that happened the jfk tokyo flights
had already been snapped up
probably by someone from tokyo who was booking the tokyo jfk versus the jfk to tokyo so if you
have no idea what i'm talking about and what are these dummy returns and these routes definitely
check out the ana episode go into super depth about it most of that episode is still relevant
the only things that have changed really is how many award tickets get released and so if you're
just trying to book for yourself just one person extremely doable you can book yourself a business
if you're trying to do two two people and i think that's probably the majority of cases you know
most of us are traveling with a p2 that's when things get challenging and that's when you have
to really brace yourself for the amount of like checking and potential stress and potential worry
that you transfer over 300 000 points and then nothing shows up for the dates that you want
luckily there are a couple backup plans if that is you like you've transferred over the miles and
now you're sort of stuck with flying a and a or you just want to do two people and then you're
really want to fly a and a because the a and a suites are still even two years later some of
the best first class and business class suites flying currently and so if you just really want
to go with a and a there are a couple little hacks that we figured out this time around that
can help you get these a and a tickets for two passengers the first easier one is just to go
with the less popular city like fly through chicago versus jfk or you know from the west coast
the downfall of the a and a is that you can't fly a and a because you can't fly a and a
the downside of flying through chicago or from chicago is that it is still running on the old
plane so you may get lucky and they switch over to the new plane but chances are you're flying the
old a and a suites which are still really really nice like you know still very much worth the cost
which is a really competitive cost which is 75k round trip for business or 150k round trip for
first so amazing rate even if you're flying the old planes and so what comes next is the
backup he booked those two chicago tickets from chicago to tokyo and that's a backup while you
know he keeps looking for the jfk flights the other option that requires a little more out of
the box thinking is that if you know you're down to go to japan for two years in a row so let's say
you're down to go in january 2025 and you'll know you'll go back again in january of 2026
one option that you have is that you can book as if you live in japan
so you would book a tokyo to jfk jfk to tokyo flight the advantage of doing that is that due
to the time change you could book tokyo to jfk on let's say january 1st and you could book jfk to
tokyo your dummy return also for january 1st and so both of those flights will release at the same
time and that puts you at a huge advantage because by being able to book both legs at the same time
you beat out anyone in the
u.s because someone in the u.s has to wait for the return flight from tokyo to be bookable and
that's not bookable until a day later due to the time change and so you essentially have a one day
head start on anyone else booking these award flights and that one day head start makes a
massive difference booking that version from tokyo to jfk and then back to tokyo that was just
totally bookable you can go online now and wait until the rewards release at 9 a.m.
and book one of those provided it's one of those days where ana decides to release two first class
tickets but if you're scratching your head thinking like how is this beneficial to have
that like i don't live in tokyo like how does this work well so the logistics are that ana gives you
a full year to use your return flight and that's why going to japan twice is key to this so you
would book your own flight from jfk to tokyo yourself you can book it you can pay for it you
can pay for it you can pay for it you can pay for it you can pay for it you can pay for it you can
which will cover in the next part of this episode so just book that separately and you get yourself
to japan and now you use the first part of your ana ticket to go from japan back home to jfk and
now you have 365 days to use the return portion of that ana booking so when you figure out when
you want to go back to japan provided it's within the year you just change the return flight to be
whenever you want to go back and you'll use that return portion of your ana award ticket
and then to get yourself back home from japan that's when you book another separate ticket
so outside of ana again you could just book japan airlines a one-way ticket back home so that's how
you can game it so that you get first dibs on any first and business award releases on ana which is
particularly useful if you're trying to book for two passengers but of course it requires you going
to japan twice which you know it may or may not be a big deal for you but it still doesn't avoid
the the inherent stress of booking award tickets with ana because it still requires you to be
checking this thing at 9 a.m tokyo time every day for the dates roughly around when you want to fly
i mean it's a lot of checking and it can be annoying and stressful to do that and you know
one of the tactics that i'd outlined in the previous episode of calling ana because they're
able to secure these seats quicker that's become less of a feasible option i think for most people
because a lot of people are calling in
now to do that and the thing with ana is that hold times can be long so sometimes you try and
call earlier and if they pick up the phone too early before 9 a.m my old strategy of sort of
just delaying them until 9 a.m turned around that seems to be no longer working so well i wonder if
they sent out some kind of a a memo or something where you know the the latest data points are just
like they're like oh you're trying to book for 9 a.m call back later and they just sort of hang
up on you they've wisened up to the delay tactics
so it's pretty hard to delay them for like 5-10 minutes on the phone nowadays if you happen to
even get through whereas before you could just sort of chit chat with them for 20-30 minutes and
it'd be fine but i think they've been told not to do that anymore and you know i think there's like
someone posted on the discord where he had seven different phone lines across like google voice
like four different cell phones a landline calling ana at the same time around 9 a.m so that if one
of them picks up early you can hang up and wait for the next call and then you can go back to
the next one it's a whole thing and it's i mean it's pretty intense for an award booking and you
kind of have to ask yourself like is this worth the stress of having to do that i mean i'm trying
to be a little less optimal these days because the real benefit of doing it this way is that
75k round trip for business 150k round trip for first just by transferring over your amex points
that is such good value like this is like every optimizer's
dream of like booking award flights but yeah you know sometimes being a little less optimal
making things a little more chill that's sort of what i'm leaning towards in 2024 and japan
airlines that is the way so that's what we're gonna cover next because japan airlines to me
feels like cheating
the thing that comes to mind
weirdly when i think of japan airlines is scuba diving so my wife and i got certified for scuba
diving back oh man it's almost been like a decade we had a trip coming up to the maldives at the
park hyatt maldives of course and we're like oh scuba is amazing there right so let's get scuba
certified and we were living on the west coast at the time near san francisco and we're like okay
where do we get scuba certified oh monterey monterey has scuba clouding so we're like oh
great let's sign up for that and let's do it so we did but the thing we didn't know was that the
monterey scuba classes which might seem really obvious to you the classes and the tests are done
in the water off of monterey which is on the west coast of california and if you've ever been on the
west coast this is the northern coast of cali too you know not like la socal malibu beach type warm
ocean this is
freezing frigid cold the coldest water you've ever experienced in your life kind of ocean and
it's churning constantly there's sand being kicked in your face your visibility is maybe like one or
two feet in front of you to give you some perspective the day of our final test we were
walking along the beach ready to get into the water and i was like why are there these men
crawling on the beach being kicked with like scuba gear on like that full wetsuit gear
on and there were other men yelling at them and shoving them over with their feet and then we
realized we're like oh this is where they test navy seals for their certification so that's what
we had to walk into and we spent like 30 minutes an hour underwater with zero visibility like 10
of us just holding each other's hands so that we wouldn't lose each other in the churn and we had
to take off our masks underwater put them back on take off our mouth hoses while not being able to
anything put it into your partner's mouth then put it back like it was a whole thing and it was
probably one of the hardest things i've ever done in my life to the point where if you told me it
was going to be like that beforehand i would have just just noped my way all the way back home so we
got certified and then we went to the maldives and we went to the maldives where the park hyatt
puts you on a boat there's like five people on the boat helping you get dressed in your scuba
gear with sandwiches and sodas and towels and then you go in the water and it is like bath water
it is literally like just floating in a bathtub while looking at pretty things like you can see
hundreds of feet in front of you little sharks little corals and we're just like man why did we
not just get certified here why did we put ourselves through scuba certification in monterey
when we could have done it
in a tropical maldives for like basically the same price because it's pretty expensive
in san francisco to get a scuba certification and that's what booking japan airlines is like
compared to booking a and a you're gonna be like is this real why have i been doing it the other
way this whole time but don't feel bad because there have been a couple changes that have made
this more i think just generally attractive as an alternative to booking a and a
the first of which being that japan airlines has delivery of brand new planes i think the a350s
the airbus and the planes have brand new suites and the suites are very nice i'll link to some
reviews and pictures so you can kind of see for yourself but yeah they're very fancy fully
enclosed they've got their door i think the first class has like a speaker system that's directed to
your head so that no one else can hear it but you can hear it and you don't have to wear a head
phone and you can hear it and you can hear it and you can hear it and you can hear it and you can
all kinds of crazy stuff and i mean some of the reviews are a little mixed especially with flyer
talk you know there's people that are plain first class connoisseurs and so they critique things
like well there's a ash wood finish that scratches really easily but i mean for the regular churner
this is sort of like comparing a 30 year aged whiskey to like a 35 year aged whiskey like you're
not gonna notice the difference between the two so i think it's a good thing that japan airlines
the difference and it's an amazing product to fly on the only downside with it is that these are
new planes being released to japan airlines and so they haven't all been made yet they're still
being built being delivered and i think right now they're scheduled to have i think eight of these
in flight in total by the end of 2024 i think seven of them are being delivered this year i
think a couple have already been delivered and so depending on the route you may not get one of these
planes but it's very good and i think it's a good thing that japan airlines have a lot of
it's very easy to check which route is scheduled to get the new plane and exactly when there's a
flyer talk thread i'll link to where people are posting pictures of these planes in production
as they move off of the various phases of production and delivery and so they're very
on top of when these routes are getting them but the the quick and dirty is that
one of the new york flights already has the new plane so new york has two flights to tokyo
on japan airlines one of them is already on the a350
the a350 after dallas fort worth that route gets it so dallas fort worth is next then the other
new york flights then i think london and i'm not sure what the next ones are but basically seven
planes are getting delivered in 2024 so if you're planning to go to japan in 2025 it's pretty easy
already to figure out some routes that you want to try and book award tickets for and the nice
part with japan airlines is that their award releases are extremely easy to track and they're
very consistent so they always release two business class tickets on every one of their
routes most routes are seeing one first class award ticket being released like the jfk routes
some routes like dallas are seeing no first class releases and some routes like lax to tokyo
they're still on the old first class they're seeing two first class tickets being released
every day and you could potentially gamble that lax maybe will get one of the new planes
depending on when you're trying to go to japan
but the nice part is that within a route it's very consistent so unlike a and a where some
days you might see 2f 1f no f on the same route with japan airlines you know what you're gonna
get you just look up your route and see whether they're releasing 0f 1f or 2f and you know they
release two business so once you just look that up it's the same every single day so it's predictable
you don't have to worry about transferring points over and then getting unlucky
with a streak of days where they're not releasing the number of seats you're expecting
additionally another massive benefit with japan airlines is that you can book one-way awards so
you don't have to wait for the return leg to be bookable and book a dummy return in order to secure
your outbound flight you can just secure the outbound flight by itself on the day it releases
and then later secure the return flight on the day it releases no more of this dummy return booking
that delays your booking by one or two days while someone in tokyo snaps up the flight which is what
happens with a and a all the time but probably the best part with japan airlines compared to a and a
is that there is no competition it is wide open for weeks to book these award tickets
with the big caveat being it depends on which partner you book your award tickets with because
japan airlines can be booked on a variety of platforms such as japan airlines and japan
partners including alaska airlines american airlines british airways cathay pacific you can
even book directly with japan airlines using their own award program but what we're going to focus on
today is why cathay pacific is in my opinion the best partner to book these tickets with
at first glance that may not seem intuitive that cathay is the best because their pricing
is one of the highest because you're paying
eighty nine thousand
miles for one way in business and a hundred and thirty five thousand miles one way in first so
that's roughly double what a and a charges and it is more expensive than what alaska and american
and british airways charges for their japan airlines partner tickets like american airlines
i think is sixty thousand miles one way in business eighty thousand in first alaska is
sixty five thousand one way in business only seventy five thousand in first so that's very
comparable to a and a whereas cathay eighty nine thousand one way in business a hundred and thirty
five thousand one way in first so why pay double the rate like even if you don't want to do a and a
why not just book it through american or alaska instead and the reason is that cathay releases
their japan airlines award tickets 360 days out specifically they release it at 12 a.m so midnight
local time for the flights that leave from the u.s. so if you're flying out from jfk midnight jfk if you're flying out from lax midnight lax and for the return flight from japan back to the u.s. that releases around nine or i think ten a.m. depending on daylight savings time tokyo time so not midnight it's nine or ten a.m. tokyo time and quick shout out to churning life by the way which is another churning podcast he has a patreon where one of the posts talked about japan airlines release times
so that saved me some time trying to figure this out myself so i'll link to his patreon in the show
notes as well but getting back to the award release window of 360 days with cathay pacific
that is truly amazing because it is so much sooner than any of the other partner airlines
so british airways releases japan airlines tickets 355 days so a little close but cathay you're
getting a five-day head start then alaska
and american airlines they get availability 331 days out so a full almost 30 days later
than cathay can see availability and as you can imagine when you look for availability
on japan airlines award tickets 331 days out all availability dries up right at the 331 day mark
because as you can imagine it becomes extremely competitive once 331 days rolls around
and everyone with alaska airline and american airlines miles have access to booking these
tickets it basically feels like searching a and a and coming up short you know but with cathay
it's wide open because you have a 30-day head start it isn't really until like day 350 that
you start seeing some availability start to drop off thanks to people booking cathay and of course
british airways they start getting access at 355 but at 360
for that first week everything is completely clear there's no stress at all when it comes to
booking you don't have to do any weird shenanigans you don't need a vpn you don't need to call cathay
and do this you do it all online and it is so easy so the question though you probably have
is like is it worth it to pay double for that level of ease and comfort and i think the question
there is really do you want to easy mode your japan flight bookings is it worth it to pay double
a hundred thousand miles round trip to save yourself the kind of stress and anxiety and just
general discomfort involved in booking an a and a trip because a hundred thousand miles is roughly
the difference between booking japan airlines via cathay compared to booking a and a directly a
hundred thousand miles round trip and you know i'm just like if you listen to this show on a pretty
regular basis or you're in our private discord you're going to be able to get a lot of information
you're probably at a point where a hundred thousand miles is not really that big of a deal
like it's not that hard to earn a hundred thousand miles like how much is your time
and your just general like mental health and well-being worth is it worth a hundred thousand
miles probably you know because like at the end of the day we're all churners here right we're not
the poor consultant who's flying every weekend and earning his miles through miles traveled in
the sky which
i've been there done that so if you're a consultant i'm insulting all of us collectively not just you
but opening a credit card you know one credit card can save you the amount of like time and effort
and energy involved going through a and a so yeah like i'm at a point where it is a solid yes when
it comes to the question of is it worth it to take the easier path and even just beyond the booking
window booking through cathay really is the easier route
like the website is so much easier to use than a and a it's not even a fair comparison plus
transfer partners they have some really nice easy to use transfer partners so american express
transfers directly one-to-one to cathay capital one does city does the only one that doesn't is
chase but you should probably have amex capital one and city points and in my opinion it's a nice
use of capital one and city points because i don't find them as useful and so i don't
as much as i do with amex and chase points but the transfers are instant regardless of which of
these programs you're transferring in from so transferring from city or capital one into cathay
happens instantly versus with a and a when you move points from american express it can be quick
like a couple days or it can take four or five six days it's again a little random and having
these instant easy transfer partners is i think another leg up for
cathay versus alaska and american airlines because those two programs don't really have
any transfer partners like american airlines you can transfer built uh the built credit card i've
been thinking about getting a built credit card but it does take up a 524 slot so i've been kind
of on the fence about it but outside of the built card you pretty much have to open an american
airlines co-branded card with city or barclays similarly with alaska pretty much you just have
to open a bank of america
alaska card which can be lucrative because with bank of america and alaska you can kind of do like
a same day apparama where you just open as many of these alaska cards in one day for a single credit
pull as they will approve you for so there is a way to accumulate alaska miles but yeah it's kind
of inconvenient you can't just transfer over from amex or chase one of the other programs
similarly with just japan airlines directly if you wanted a book using japan airlines award
miles
the only way to transfer over is via marriott at a three to one rate which is terrible i mean
marriott also you can transfer to american airlines and marriott to alaska airlines but again
at the three to one rate so also terrible i think bonvoy marriott bonvoy you can transfer anywhere
pretty much at three to one because every program wants to accept it at that terrible exchange rate
because they're just making money off of it so i think that's the reason why marriott points can be
transferred pretty much anywhere
but yeah with all of those benefits added up together for booking kato via japan airlines
that's ultimately what we ended up doing so i'll walk through kind of just what we ended up booking
and a couple of the the quirks because you know no process is totally smooth so there's a couple
things to keep in mind if you're going to do this yourself that i kind of wish i knew ahead of time
too so cathay i booked it for both myself and my wife my p2 it was 89 000 miles in business each
way. So 178,000 miles per person times two. The first little snag I kind of hit when I was trying
to transfer my miles over, initially I was transferring Amex miles over to Cathay Pacific's
Asia miles program, was that my miles just didn't show up. So I did a 1000 point transfer first,
just to kind of, you know, make sure I linked my account correctly, everything was good,
nothing showed up. Then I did it with my wife, instead of doing a 1000 point transfer,
I just sent over the full like 178,000 miles and that showed up instantly. So I was like,
why are my miles not showing up? And I waited a few days and that 1000 points just never came.
So then I just did a larger transfer, like 178,000 and that showed up instantly to my account where
the 1000 didn't. So something about a 1000 mile test transfer, I don't know if it's consistently
like this, it's just slower. Like it must be going through some other channel versus a large
transfer that happens immediately. So kind of counterintuitive, but I would just transfer the
full amount, just make sure you put your awards number in correctly, and then just transfer in
the full amount. If you do it incorrectly, what happens is it goes to a manual review step over
at Cathay Pacific, and someone has to manually look at it and approve it and be like, why doesn't
these numbers match? Why doesn't the name match, for example. So you want to make sure that you're
transferring to the right account number with names matching on both ends.
So that's kind of counterintuitive, but I would just transfer the full amount, just make sure you
other snag I hit while transferring, which wasn't Cathay's fault or anyone other than Capital One,
was that when I was transferring some Capital One miles over, it ended up freezing, Capital One
froze my Capital One account because I tried to move 178,000 miles over from Capital One to Asia
Miles. I'm not exactly sure why that happened, like why the freeze happened. I have a couple
theories. One was that I just linked the Asia Miles account and then immediately went to
transfer a large sum of miles, and that triggered their fraud thing where I had to call and just be
like, hey, I did mean to transfer it because they'd frozen it for the reward transfer. The other
theory is that I gotten the signup bonus like the day before I did the transfer. So I got like
150,000 miles through the Capital One VentureX business card, and then immediately went to
transfer all of that over to Asia Miles. And maybe that was too soon. They didn't like that I just got
the bonus.
And then immediately tried to move it. So not totally sure, but just keep in mind that Capital
One, if you're doing it that way, may freeze your account. The miles still showed up fine though,
so I wasn't too worried about it. I was more worried that maybe Capital One had frozen my
account for some other reason, like meeting the minimum spend too quickly, but that was not the
case. Amex transfers went through totally fine though, so definitely kind of just a Capital One
quirk. Then once the miles arrived, I got ready to call Cathay. And the reason I wanted to call
Cathay was because I was thinking I'd have them hold one of the legs. I was doing a Dallas-Fort Worth
to Haneda, Tokyo flight. And I wanted them to hold it because I wanted to also add a free connection,
which is something you can do with Cathay and Japan Airlines, is you can continue on. And I
landed in Haneda, and instead of paying for a flight from Haneda to Osaka, I wanted to add the,
Osaka leg. But because of the time zone difference in Japan, the Dallas-Fort Worth to Haneda,
that portion opens first. And then a day later, the Haneda to Osaka leg opens because it's a day
later in Japan when you land. And so I didn't want the first leg to be booked by someone else
while I was waiting for the second connection to be open. So you can just call and they'll do a
48-hour hold. I called around midnight,
because if you recall from earlier, that's when these award tickets get released is local time in
the U.S. for the flights to depart from the U.S. So I called midnight Dallas time, spent about 30
minutes waiting to get someone on the phone. They applied the 48-hour hold. Everything was gravy.
I mean, in hindsight, you didn't need to do that at all because, again, these Cathay Pacific Japan
Airlines flights, they are not getting booked up. I was still in that jaded A&A scarcity mindset of
man, I got to...
Get these tickets as soon as they open, make sure no one else gets them so that I can grab them,
you know, and like, I got to make sure I put this on hold in case. Yeah, you don't need to worry
about that at all with Cathay. So if you want the peace of mind and you are trying to do the
connection, sure, put it on hold. But yeah, this stuff was open like a week after I booked. So it
was sort of unnecessary to stay up late and then be on hold and then do this and have to call back
the next day to add the free Osaka leg. But that is what I ended up doing, which is just calling
the next day around 9 or 10 a.m. Japan time and having them add the Osaka leg to my held leg. And
that actually turned out to be more complicated than I thought it'd be because another quirk with
Cathay is that they can't seem to find domestic Japan airline flights individually. What I mean
by that is even on the website, if you go and you search for Tokyo to Osaka, nothing will show up.
However, if you search JFK,
to Osaka, it will return a Japan Airlines flight that goes from JFK to Tokyo and another flight
that goes from Tokyo to Osaka. So the Tokyo to Osaka flight can only be seen and booked when
it's searched for and booked as part of a full flight that isn't just domestic to Japan. So that
was a little weird to like explain to the agent on the phone because I called back and I was like,
I'm looking for the Tokyo to Osaka flight. And he's like, there's no Tokyo to Osaka flight. And so
I basically had to teach him that the way to see the Tokyo to Osaka flight is to actually plug in
Dallas-Fort Worth to Osaka. And then you'll see that, oh, yeah, there is a Tokyo to Osaka flight,
but it has to be part of this like itinerary, I guess, that departs from outside of Japan
versus just being a purely Japan domestic flight. Yeah, it's a little weird. But after he figured
that out, he was able to book it. So you probably don't even have to go to Tokyo to Osaka to book it.
This madness of calling in and having them do that because I didn't need to hold the flight,
the first leg in the first place. It was totally bookable the next day as well,
because these aren't getting taken up until the other partners get availability. And that doesn't
happen until 355 or 331 days out. Another idea that might have crossed your mind, because it
definitely crossed mine, is that like, what if we booked this as a round trip flight instead of two
one-day flights? And I think that's a really good idea. I think that's a really good idea.
Given these tickets aren't being snatched up immediately, you have time to potentially book
it as a round trip. And the benefit potentially of booking is round trip is with Cathay, at least
from what I read and researched online, is that Cathay allows up to five stopovers on a round trip
award ticket. They used to allow stopovers on even a one-way ticket, but I think that ended in 2020.
So now it's only on round trip. And the benefit of that potentially of having these stopovers
on a round trip is that you could fly to Tokyo and just hang out in Tokyo for a week and then
continue on from Tokyo to, let's say, Osaka, spend another week on Osaka. Maybe you do an open jaw
and you get yourself over to Sapporo. And then after spending another week in Sapporo, you fly
over to Tokyo, spend another week in Tokyo, and then you fly back to the US. That, in theory,
could all be booked as part of one round trip Cathay Japan Airlines award ticket for the
same number of miles. The reason I think in practice, this may not actually be possible
is because you can't search for, and not just you, the agents also can't search for and find
domestic Japan legs by themselves. So they'd have to be able to find like a Sapporo to Tokyo flight
or an Osaka to Tokyo flight. And they can't do that unless they search for a city in the US
and then a city in Japan. They can't seem to find any of these domestic
flights. So they can't do that unless they search for a city in the US and then a city in Japan.
So that's why I think, you know, it probably wouldn't work. But if you've gotten it to work,
I would love to hear any data points of this because it would save you a bit of money. But
at the same time, these domestic flights in Japan, they're like $100 each way anyway. So
it's not really that big of a deal. You'd save a few hundred bucks. But if anyone has tried it
and got it to work, definitely let me know. I'm very curious. But at minimum, though, booking a
connection, though, not a stopover, just a connection, that's definitely very doable.
And you can do that yourself.
Over the phone or on the website. But again, just have to remind the agent that they can't
search for just the connection leg by itself. But yeah, at least with our booking, though,
after I got the outbound flight all the way to Osaka secured, a couple weeks later, I went online
and just this time myself booked the Tokyo back to Dallas Fort Worth one way flight for both myself
and P2 in business class. And that was it. I mean, other than just getting ourselves to Dallas Fort
Worth, we'll probably just like do a Southwest or United positioning flight. We have companion
pass this year. So really easy and cheap to do positioning flights to get into some of these
cities. And I'm also just going to keep an eye out on exactly when they switch over the Dallas
Fort Worth flight to the new Airbus A350, because I want to make sure that we are on the new suites,
which they have a whole year to do it. And it's next on the list. So I feel pretty confident that
by January 2025, it will be on the new suites by then. But if we have to make changes with Cathay,
it's $50 for a change and $120 for a cancellation. So pretty reasonable. And I might even keep my eye
out for any first class availability to see if I can maybe just cancel and then move us over to
first class. But we would need two first class seats, which may not be that feasible. But if
you're traveling solo, I would definitely splurge.
On getting the 135,000 point first class seat, even if you only do it one way, this isn't like
ANA where you're committed to both legs. You can just do it for one of the legs just to kind of
try it. It's kind of a bucket list flight for sure. But all in all, just a super easy, very
chill process. If it wasn't for me having to do the flight hold, I could have done it all online
in like five or 10 minutes compared to the craziness of ANA. So definitely A++, would book
it. It was so not time consuming that I even had time while I was waiting for the return flight to
open up to book eight business class tickets to Taiwan for another trip that we're doing. But
that is a story for another episode. All right, that's it for this episode. Hopefully you found
it helpful. Hopefully your next Japan trip goes a little smoother. You know, you keep a little bit
more of your sanity when it comes to booking these award tickets. And hopefully it gave you
permission a little bit to spend a little bit of your time. And I'll see you in the next episode.
points on tickets that can save you a lot of stress compared to some of the other more optimal
options. I know there was a lot of info covered in this episode, but as always, you can find the
show notes at thedailychurnpodcast.com. Some listeners have also forwarded me like AI summaries
of these episodes. So I might try one of these services out for this one and just see how well
or not the AI summarizes the level of information in this. But if it turns out,
well, I'll post that AI summary as well on the website. And finally, if you enjoyed this kind
of award hacking, travel booking type of an episode, definitely check out my friend's blog
at kungflu.com. He has a bunch of great articles on award travel and award bookings and was so
instrumental to our 2025 Japan bookings that he probably deserves some kind of research credit
or something for this episode. So definitely check him out. But otherwise, I will catch you
all next time.
The February churning recap. Thanks for tuning in. See ya.
